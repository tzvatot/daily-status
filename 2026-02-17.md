# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Completed [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API enhancement implementation with explicit field types (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType)
- Implemented backward compatibility layer ensuring new structured fields map correctly to existing template parameters (verified via AAP job logs)
- Implemented runStrategy controller logic enabling runtime VM stop/start control
- Created and validated comprehensive unit tests (84/84 passing) covering parameter mapping, immutability, and edge cases
- Successfully deployed and tested in vmaas-dev cluster with live provisioning verification
- Validated immutability constraints (cores, memoryGiB, image) and mutability of runStrategy field via kubectl patch operations
- Created pull request https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/111 for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)
- Completed planning phase for Jobs Array Extension project (ClusterOrder and HostPool) with comprehensive implementation plan document

## Risks & Challenges
- ComputeInstance Phase shows "Running" when runStrategy=Halted (minor cosmetic issue - VM state correctly reflected in VirtualMachine resource)
- Changing runStrategy triggers desiredConfigVersion update causing brief "Applying configuration" state (cosmetic, no actual re-provisioning)

## Key Effort
Implementing explicit field types for ComputeInstance API with full backward compatibility and runtime VM control
