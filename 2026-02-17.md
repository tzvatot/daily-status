# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Completed [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API enhancement implementation - added explicit typed fields (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType), immutability validation via CEL XValidation rules, backward compatibility mapping, and runStrategy controller logic for VM stop/start
- Created comprehensive unit tests for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) - 84/84 specs passing with backward compatibility test coverage
- Successfully deployed and tested [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) on vmaas-dev cluster - verified new API fields, provisioning, immutability enforcement, and runStrategy VM lifecycle control
- Created E2E test suite for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) - 5 comprehensive Ansible tests covering runStrategy mutability and immutability validation
- Fixed critical deprovision bug in [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) - ensured templateParameters generated before deprovision for proper AAP playbook cleanup
- Completed Jobs Array Extension implementation - extended ComputeInstance jobs array pattern to ClusterOrder and HostPool resources with provider abstraction
- Fixed critical EDA provider bug - extended webhook URL support from 2 to 6 URLs (2 per resource type: ComputeInstance, ClusterOrder, HostPool)
- Created shared job helpers package (internal/helpers/job_helpers.go) - reduced code duplication by ~150 lines across controllers
- Integrated provider abstraction into ClusterOrder controller - hybrid approach combining job tracking audit trail with HC watching for readiness
- Integrated provider abstraction into HostPool controller - replaced fire-and-forget webhooks with job polling for explicit failure detection
- Updated all controller configurations - single shared ProvisioningProvider instance serves all resource types
- Rebased Jobs Array Extension branch on latest upstream/main - resolved import path conflicts across 61 files (osac/osac-operator → osac-project/osac-operator)
- Pushed 9 commits to [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) branch - includes API changes, backward compatibility, runStrategy logic, deprovision fix, test fixes, and import path corrections
- Created pull request for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) - https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/111 with 9 commits ready for review
- Created draft pull request for Jobs Array Extension - https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/110 ready for E2E test planning

## Risks & Challenges
- [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) known limitation: ComputeInstance Phase doesn't reflect stopped state when runStrategy=Halted (VirtualMachine status correct, cosmetic issue requiring future phase state additions)
- Jobs Array Extension needs comprehensive E2E testing before merge - test plan creation required for osac-test-infra covering ClusterOrder and HostPool job lifecycle scenarios

## Key Effort
API enhancement and provisioning pattern consistency improvements across OSAC operator resources
