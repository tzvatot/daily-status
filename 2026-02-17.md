# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- **API Implementation Complete**: Added explicit field types to ComputeInstance API ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)) - replaced JSON-encoded `templateParameters` with structured, typed fields (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType)
- **CRD & Code Generation**: Successfully regenerated CRD with OpenAPI schema validation, deepcopy code, and printer columns showing new fields (Template, Cores, Memory, RunStrategy, Phase)
- **Validation Implementation**: Added CEL immutability rules (all fields except `runStrategy`), required field validation, range validation (cores: 1-128, memoryGiB: 1-1024), and enum validation
- **Test Infrastructure Updated**: Created `newTestComputeInstanceSpec()` helper function, updated 35+ test fixtures across 5 controller test files, added comprehensive Ginkgo/Gomega unit tests - all 70+ tests passing
- **Deployment & Live Testing**: Created git worktree, committed changes, pushed to fork `tzvatot/cloudkit-operator`, built container image `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-8818ff6`, deployed to vmaas-dev cluster, CRD updated successfully
- **Jobs Array Extension - Planning Complete**: Created comprehensive implementation plan (`merry-stargazing-graham.md`) for extending jobs array pattern to ClusterOrder and HostPool resources with provider abstraction, backward compatibility strategy, and E2E test infrastructure

## Risks & Challenges
- **Provisioning Failure Investigation**: Test ComputeInstance entered Failed state (Job ID 11885) - need to investigate how controller passes new structured fields to AAP/EDA templates, verify template `rhel_9_base` exists and parameter format compatibility, may need dual parameter passing for backward compatibility

## Key Effort
Completed ComputeInstance API enhancement ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)) with full validation and testing infrastructure, deployed to cluster - now investigating provisioning integration with templates
