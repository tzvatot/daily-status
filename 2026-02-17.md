# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Completed API implementation for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) - ComputeInstance API Enhancement with explicit field types replacing `templateParameters`
- Added new structured API types: `ImageSpec`, `DiskSpec`, `RunStrategyType` enum with full OpenAPI validation
- Implemented immutability constraints on all fields except `runStrategy` using CEL validation rules
- Regenerated CRDs and DeepCopy code, updated 35+ test fixtures across 5 test files
- All unit tests passing (70 controller tests + API tests), linter passing with 0 issues
- Deployed to vmaas-dev cluster - API validation working correctly, new printer columns displaying
- Created comprehensive implementation plan for Jobs Array Extension to ClusterOrder and HostPool resources
- Completed codebase exploration comparing current fire-and-forget patterns vs. ComputeInstance job tracking approach
- Designed hybrid approach for ClusterOrder (job tracking + HC watching) and full job polling for HostPool

## Risks & Challenges
- Provisioning failure in testing - ComputeInstance enters Failed state (Job ID 11885)
- Investigation needed: Controller may not be passing new structured fields to templates correctly, or templates may still expect old `templateParameters` format
- Backward compatibility concern: May need dual parameter passing approach during migration

## Key Effort
Implementing structured field types for ComputeInstance API with validation and testing infrastructure, while planning jobs array extension to other provisioning resources.
