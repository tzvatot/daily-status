# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Completed API implementation for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) - ComputeInstance API Enhancement
  - Added structured fields (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType) replacing JSON-encoded templateParameters
  - Implemented immutability validation via CEL rules (all fields except runStrategy)
  - Regenerated CRDs with OpenAPI schema validation
  - Updated 5 test files with 35+ test fixture usages
  - All unit tests pass (70 controller tests + API tests), linter clean
- Deployed and tested new API on vmaas-dev cluster
  - Created git worktree, committed changes, built container image `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-8818ff6`
  - Successfully deployed operator with updated CRD
  - Validated API accepts new structured fields correctly
  - Identified provisioning failure requiring investigation of template parameter passing
- Completed planning for Jobs Array Extension project
  - Created comprehensive implementation plan (`merry-stargazing-graham.md`)
  - Analyzed ClusterOrder and HostPool controllers for jobs array integration
  - Designed hybrid approach for ClusterOrder (job tracking + HC watching)
  - Planned E2E test infrastructure in osac-test-infra repo

## Risks & Challenges
- [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103): Provisioning failed in testing - controller may not be passing new structured fields to AAP/EDA templates correctly, or templates may still expect old templateParameters format. Requires investigation of parameter serialization and template compatibility.

## Key Effort
Implementing and deploying structured API fields for ComputeInstance with validation, testing provisioning integration with AAP/EDA templates.
