# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- ✅ Completed [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) API implementation - Added explicit field types to ComputeInstance API (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType) replacing JSON-encoded templateParameters
- ✅ Regenerated CRDs with OpenAPI schema validation, added CEL immutability rules for all fields except runStrategy
- ✅ Updated all controller test fixtures (5 test files, 35+ usages) and added comprehensive Ginkgo/Gomega unit tests
- ✅ All validation passes: code formatting, linter (0 issues), 70+ unit tests, CRD generation
- ✅ Deployed [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) to vmaas-dev cluster - Git worktree created, branch pushed to fork, container image built (quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-8818ff6)
- ✅ Live testing confirms API validation working correctly - new structured fields accepted, printer columns showing cores/memory/runStrategy
- ✅ Completed planning for Jobs Array Extension to ClusterOrder and HostPool - comprehensive implementation plan created covering 6 phases with git worktree approach
- 🚧 Debugging [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) provisioning failure - Job 11885 entered Failed state, investigating controller parameter passing to templates

## Risks & Challenges
- [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103): Provisioning failure during testing - templates may not be handling new structured fields correctly, controller serialization to AAP/EDA needs investigation

## Key Effort
ComputeInstance API enhancement implementation and deployment testing with new explicit field types for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)
