# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Completed [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API enhancement implementation with explicit typed fields (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType)
- Implemented backward compatibility layer ensuring existing templates work with new API schema
- Developed and validated runStrategy controller logic enabling VM stop/start functionality
- Created comprehensive E2E tests for API immutability validation and runStrategy mutability
- Successfully deployed and tested implementation in vmaas-dev cluster with live VM provisioning
- Completed jobs array extension implementation for ClusterOrder and HostPool resources
- Created shared job helpers package reducing code duplication by ~150 lines
- Fixed critical EDA provider bug - extended from 2 to 6 webhook URLs for resource-specific endpoints
- Extended AAP and EDA providers to support all resource types (ComputeInstance, ClusterOrder, HostPool)
- Created PR #111 for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) (ready for review) and draft PR #110 for jobs array extension
- All unit tests passing (84/84 for API, 70.8% coverage for provisioning package)

## Risks & Challenges
- ComputeInstance Phase doesn't reflect stopped state when runStrategy=Halted (documented as future work)
- Config version changes cosmetically when runStrategy changes (no actual re-provisioning, future improvement)
- E2E tests for jobs array extension pending implementation in osac-test-infra

## Key Effort
Implementing API enhancements and extending provider abstraction patterns across OSAC operator resource types
