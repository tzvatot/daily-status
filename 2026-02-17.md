# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Completed [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) - ComputeInstance API Enhancement implementation
- Added explicit field types to ComputeInstance API (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType) with 8 new structured fields replacing templateParameters
- Implemented immutability validation via CEL XValidation rules for all fields except runStrategy
- Implemented backward compatibility function (`ensureBackwardCompatibility()`) mapping new fields to old parameter names, verified via AAP job logs
- Implemented `syncRunStrategy()` controller logic for VM stop/start functionality
- Created comprehensive unit tests (84/84 passing) including backward compatibility test suite
- Successfully deployed and tested implementation in vmaas-dev cluster
- Verified live provisioning with new API fields and immutability constraints
- Created E2E tests (5 comprehensive tests) covering runStrategy mutability and immutability validation
- Created pull request: https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/111
- Completed requirements gathering and implementation planning for Jobs Array Extension project
- Created comprehensive implementation plan (`merry-stargazing-graham.md`) for extending jobs array pattern to ClusterOrder and HostPool resources
- Analyzed ClusterOrder and HostPool controller implementations and designed hybrid approach maintaining backward compatibility

## Risks & Challenges
- ComputeInstance Phase doesn't reflect stopped state when runStrategy=Halted (documented as future work)
- Config version changes when runStrategy changes causing cosmetic "Applying configuration" state (documented as future improvement)

## Key Effort
Completed [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) implementation with full testing coverage and created implementation plan for Jobs Array Extension project.
