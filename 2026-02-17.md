# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Completed full implementation of [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) - ComputeInstance API Enhancement
  - Added explicit field types (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType) replacing JSON-encoded templateParameters
  - Implemented backward compatibility mapping (new fields → old parameter names)
  - Implemented runStrategy controller logic for VM stop/start functionality
  - Created comprehensive unit tests (84/84 passing) and E2E tests (5 test scenarios)
  - Pull request created: https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/111
- Completed Jobs Array Extension implementation for ClusterOrder and HostPool resources
  - Extended jobs array pattern from ComputeInstance to ClusterOrder and HostPool
  - Extracted shared job helper functions (FindJobByID, UpdateJob, AppendJob)
  - Extended AAP and EDA providers for all resource types
  - Fixed critical EDA provider bug (6 resource-specific webhooks instead of 2 generic ones)
  - Implemented hybrid approach for ClusterOrder (job tracking + HC watching)
  - Replaced fire-and-forget webhooks in HostPool with job polling
  - Pull request created (draft): https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/110
- All validations passing: compilation, formatting, linting (0 issues), unit tests (70.8% coverage)

## Risks & Challenges
- ComputeInstance Phase doesn't reflect stopped state when runStrategy=Halted (minor cosmetic issue - VM state correctly reflected in VirtualMachine resource)
- Config version changes when runStrategy changes (cosmetic - no actual re-provisioning occurs)
- Jobs Array Extension needs E2E tests before production deployment

## Key Effort
API enhancements and provider abstraction improvements for OSAC operator resources
