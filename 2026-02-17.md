# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Completed [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) - ComputeInstance API Enhancement implementation
  - Added explicit field types (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType) replacing JSON-encoded templateParameters
  - Implemented validation rules with CEL XValidation for immutability enforcement
  - Built backward compatibility layer (ensureBackwardCompatibility function) mapping new fields to old parameter names
  - Implemented runStrategy controller logic (syncRunStrategy) for VM stop/start operations
  - Verified live VM provisioning, stop/start functionality, and immutability validation
  - Created comprehensive unit tests (84/84 passing) and E2E test suite (5 tests)
  - Created pull request https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/111 with 4 commits
- Completed planning phase for Jobs Array Extension project
  - Analyzed ClusterOrder and HostPool controllers for extending jobs array pattern
  - Created comprehensive implementation plan (6 phases) with test infrastructure design
  - Identified hybrid approach for ClusterOrder (job tracking + HC watching) and full job polling replacement for HostPool

## Risks & Challenges
- Minor phase discrepancy: ComputeInstance Phase shows "Running" even when runStrategy=Halted (documented for future work)
- Config version changes when runStrategy changes (cosmetic, future improvement)

## Key Effort
Implementing and validating explicit field types for ComputeInstance API with backward compatibility and runStrategy controller logic
