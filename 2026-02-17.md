# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Completed API implementation for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) - ComputeInstance API Enhancement
  - Added structured API fields (`ImageSpec`, `DiskSpec`, `RunStrategyType`) replacing JSON-encoded `templateParameters`
  - Implemented comprehensive validation with CEL rules (immutability, ranges, enums)
  - Regenerated CRDs and DeepCopy code
  - Updated all controller test fixtures (5 files, 35+ usages)
  - All unit tests passing (70+ tests), linter clean, code formatted
- Deployed [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) changes to vmaas-dev cluster
  - Created git worktree and feature branch
  - Built and deployed container image (`quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-8818ff6`)
  - Successfully created test ComputeInstance with new API fields
  - API validation and printer columns working correctly
- Identified provisioning failure issue requiring investigation
  - Job created but failed - controller may not be passing new fields to templates correctly
  - Need to verify template parameter format compatibility
- Completed comprehensive planning for Jobs Array Extension project
  - Analyzed ClusterOrder and HostPool controller implementations
  - Created detailed implementation plan with 6 phases
  - Designed hybrid approach for ClusterOrder (job tracking + HC watching)
  - Planned E2E test infrastructure

## Risks & Challenges
- [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103): Provisioning failing with new API fields - controller serialization to templates needs investigation
- [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103): May need backward compatibility layer to support both old `templateParameters` and new structured fields during migration
- Jobs Array Extension: Requires git worktrees due to concurrent development with other work

## Key Effort
API enhancement implementation for ComputeInstance with structured typed fields and deployment testing
