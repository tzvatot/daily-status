# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Completed ComputeInstance API enhancement ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)) - added explicit field types (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType) with CEL validation rules
- Implemented backward compatibility layer mapping new API fields to existing template parameters, verified via AAP job logs
- Implemented runStrategy controller logic enabling VM stop/start functionality through ComputeInstance API
- Created comprehensive unit test suite (84/84 passing) covering API validation, backward compatibility, and parameter mapping
- Successfully deployed and tested new API in vmaas-dev cluster with live VM provisioning
- Verified immutability validation for cores, memoryGiB, and image fields via CEL XValidation rules
- Verified runStrategy mutability with live VM stop (Always→Halted) and start (Halted→Always) tests
- Created pull request for osac-operator (#111) with 4 commits implementing API changes and controller logic
- Developed comprehensive E2E test suite (5 tests) covering runStrategy mutations and immutability validation
- Completed requirements gathering and implementation planning for Jobs Array Extension project

## Risks & Challenges
- ComputeInstance Phase doesn't reflect stopped state when runStrategy=Halted (documented as future work)
- Config version changes when runStrategy changes causing brief "Applying configuration" state (cosmetic issue, documented for future improvement)

## Key Effort
Successfully implemented and validated ComputeInstance API enhancement with explicit typed fields, backward compatibility, and runStrategy VM lifecycle management
