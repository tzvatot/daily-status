# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Analyzed user requirements for extending jobs array to ClusterOrder and HostPool
- Deep analysis of ClusterOrder controller implementation (watch-based lifecycle, fire-and-forget EDA webhooks, no job tracking)
- Deep analysis of HostPool controller implementation (fire-and-forget webhooks, no polling/callbacks)
- Comparison with ComputeInstance pattern (jobs array, ProvisioningProvider interface, job lifecycle management)
- Created comprehensive implementation plan document: `merry-stargazing-graham.md`
- Designed hybrid approach for ClusterOrder (job tracking + HC watching)
- Designed replacement for HostPool fire-and-forget pattern (poll job until Succeeded → Phase=Ready)
- Planned test infrastructure with new E2E tests in osac-test-infra repo
- Defined 6 implementation phases (Phase 0: Git worktree setup through Phase 6: Configuration)
- Identified all files to modify (API changes, new shared code, provider extensions, controller integration)
- Completed requirements gathering, codebase exploration, implementation plan, and test infrastructure planning

## Risks & Challenges
- CRD upgrade failure (mitigated: jobs array is optional field for backward compatibility)
- Provider breaking existing webhooks (mitigated: fallback to webhooks if provider=nil)
- Job polling creating load (mitigated: stagger intervals, exponential backoff)
- AAP API rate limits (mitigated: already handled by RateLimitError)
- Job history unbounded growth (mitigated: MaxJobHistory limit default 10)
- Git worktrees REQUIRED due to concurrent development

## Key Effort
Planning phase for extending jobs array pattern and AAP provider support from ComputeInstance to ClusterOrder and HostPool resources with comprehensive implementation plan and test infrastructure design.
