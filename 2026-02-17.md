# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Completed API schema implementation with explicit fields (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType) for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)
- Implemented backward compatibility mapping (new fields → old parameter names) verified via AAP job logs
- Implemented runStrategy controller logic enabling VM stop/start functionality
- Successfully deployed and tested in vmaas-dev cluster with live VM provisioning
- Created comprehensive unit tests (84/84 passing) for backward compatibility
- Verified immutability validation via CEL XValidation rules (cores, memoryGiB, image)
- Created E2E test suite (5 tests) covering runStrategy mutability and immutability validation
- Created Pull Request #111 for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) implementation (4 commits)
- Completed Jobs Array Extension planning phase with detailed implementation plan (merry-stargazing-graham.md)
- Analyzed ClusterOrder and HostPool controller implementations for jobs array integration
- Designed hybrid approach for ClusterOrder (job tracking + HC watching) and polling approach for HostPool
- Created test infrastructure plan for osac-test-infra with 4 new test files

## Risks & Challenges
- ComputeInstance Phase doesn't reflect stopped state when runStrategy=Halted (cosmetic issue, documented for future work)
- Config version changes when runStrategy changes (cosmetic, no re-provisioning occurs)

## Key Effort
Primary focus on completing [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API enhancement with full implementation, testing, and validation
