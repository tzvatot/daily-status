# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Completed MGMT-23103: ComputeInstance API Enhancement with explicit field types ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103))
  - Implemented new structured types (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType) replacing templateParameters
  - Added backward compatibility layer with `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` function
  - Implemented runStrategy controller logic for VM stop/start functionality
  - Fixed deprovision bug (templateParameters generation) and feedback controller tests
  - Updated 61 files for import path corrections (osac-project org migration)
  - Created comprehensive unit tests (84 tests) and E2E test playbooks
  - Pull Request: https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/111 (20 commits)
- Completed Jobs Array Extension implementation
  - Extended jobs array pattern from ComputeInstance to ClusterOrder and HostPool resources
  - Extracted shared job helpers to reduce code duplication (~150 lines)
  - Fixed critical EDA provider bug (extended from 2 to 6 webhook URLs for resource-specific webhooks)
  - Implemented hybrid approach for ClusterOrder (job tracking + HC watching)
  - Replaced fire-and-forget webhooks with job polling for HostPool
  - Pull Request: https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/110 (Draft, 3 commits)
- Created E2E test infrastructure for ComputeInstance API fields
  - Built comprehensive Ansible playbook with 5 test scenarios (runStrategy mutability, immutability validation)
  - Test role: `test_compute_instance_api_fields` in osac-test-infra repository

## Risks & Challenges
- ComputeInstance Phase doesn't reflect stopped state when runStrategy=Halted (minor, future work needed)
- Jobs Array Extension requires E2E test implementation before merge (test planning needed)
- Import path corrections required across 61 files due to repository migration

## Key Effort
API enhancement and backward compatibility implementation for ComputeInstance with comprehensive testing and bug fixes
