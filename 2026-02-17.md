# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Completed API implementation for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) - ComputeInstance API Enhancement with explicit field types (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType)
- Added comprehensive validation rules (immutability constraints, value ranges, enum validation)
- Successfully regenerated CRDs and DeepCopy code, passing all unit tests (70 controller tests + API tests)
- Created git worktree, committed changes, and deployed to vmaas-dev cluster with CRD updates
- Built and deployed container image `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-8818ff6`
- Verified API field acceptance and validation working correctly with test instance
- Completed planning phase for Jobs Array Extension project - created comprehensive implementation plan (`merry-stargazing-graham.md`) covering ClusterOrder and HostPool resources with hybrid approach

## Risks & Challenges
- [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) provisioning failure in testing - Job ID 11885 failed, need to investigate parameter passing to templates and verify template compatibility with new structured fields vs legacy `templateParameters` JSON string

## Key Effort
Implementing and deploying explicit typed fields for ComputeInstance API to replace JSON-encoded parameters, with successful deployment but provisioning failure requiring investigation.
