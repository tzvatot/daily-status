# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Completed implementation of [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API Enhancement with explicit field types (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType)
- Implemented backward compatibility layer mapping new API fields to legacy template parameters
- Implemented runStrategy controller logic enabling runtime VM stop/start operations
- Created comprehensive E2E tests for ComputeInstance API validation and runStrategy mutability
- Created Pull Request [#111](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/111) with 4 commits for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)
- Completed full implementation of jobs array extension to ClusterOrder and HostPool resources
- Fixed critical bug in EDA provider - extended from 2 to 6 webhook URLs for resource-specific routing
- Created shared job helpers package reducing code duplication by ~150 lines
- Extended AAP and EDA providers to support all three resource types (ComputeInstance, ClusterOrder, HostPool)
- Created Pull Request [#110](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/110) (Draft) for jobs array extension

## Risks & Challenges
- ComputeInstance Phase doesn't reflect stopped state when runStrategy=Halted (documented as future work)
- Config version changes when runStrategy changes causing brief "Applying configuration" state (cosmetic issue)
- Jobs array extension requires E2E testing before final approval

## Key Effort
Delivered complete API enhancement with backward compatibility and runtime VM control for ComputeInstance, plus architectural improvement extending jobs array pattern to ClusterOrder and HostPool resources
