# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Completed API implementation for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) - ComputeInstance API Enhancement
  - Added `ImageSpec`, `DiskSpec`, and `RunStrategyType` to ComputeInstance API
  - Implemented structured fields (image, cores, memoryGiB, bootDisk, additionalDisks, runStrategy, userDataSecretRef, sshKey)
  - Added comprehensive validation rules (immutability via XValidation CEL, value ranges, required fields)
  - Regenerated CRD with OpenAPI schema and updated printer columns
  - Updated all controller test fixtures across 5 test files (35+ usages)
  - Created comprehensive Ginkgo/Gomega unit tests for new API types
  - All tests passing (70 controller tests + API tests, linter with 0 issues)
- Deployed and tested [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) implementation on vmaas-dev cluster
  - Created git worktree, committed changes (8818ff6), pushed to fork `tzvatot/cloudkit-operator`
  - Built and deployed container image `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-8818ff6`
  - Successfully created test ComputeInstance with new API fields
  - Verified API validation and printer columns working correctly
  - Identified provisioning failure requiring investigation of parameter passing to templates
- Completed planning for Jobs Array Extension project
  - Deep analysis of ClusterOrder and HostPool controller implementations
  - Created comprehensive implementation plan (`merry-stargazing-graham.md`)
  - Designed hybrid approach (job tracking + HC watching for ClusterOrder)
  - Planned shared job helpers extraction and provider extensions
  - Defined 6 implementation phases with backward compatibility strategy
  - Planned E2E test infrastructure in osac-test-infra repo

## Risks & Challenges
- [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) provisioning failure needs investigation - controller may not be correctly passing new structured fields to AAP/EDA templates, or templates may still expect old `templateParameters` format

## Key Effort
ComputeInstance API enhancement implementation, deployment, and testing with focus on structured field validation and backward compatibility
