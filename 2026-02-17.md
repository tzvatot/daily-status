# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Completed ComputeInstance API Enhancement ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)) - added explicit field types (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType) with validation rules, backward compatibility, and runStrategy controller logic
- Deployed and tested [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) in vmaas-dev cluster - verified provisioning, immutability validation, and VM stop/start functionality
- Created PR #111 for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) with 4 commits (API schema, backward compatibility, controller logic, docs)
- Implemented E2E tests for ComputeInstance API fields - runStrategy mutability and immutability validation (5 comprehensive tests)
- Completed Jobs Array Extension implementation - extended jobs array pattern from ComputeInstance to ClusterOrder and HostPool resources
- Fixed critical EDA provider bug - extended from 2 to 6 webhook URLs (resource-specific URLs for ComputeInstance, ClusterOrder, HostPool)
- Created shared job helpers package - extracted reusable functions (FindJobByID, UpdateJob, AppendJob) reducing code duplication by ~150 lines
- Rebased Jobs Array Extension PR #110 on latest upstream/main - resolved import path conflicts

## Risks & Challenges
- ClusterOrder Phase doesn't reflect stopped state when runStrategy=Halted (documented as future work)
- Jobs Array Extension PR #110 awaiting E2E test implementation before final review

## Key Effort
API enhancements and jobs array pattern extension for OSAC operator resources with comprehensive testing and backward compatibility
