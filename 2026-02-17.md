# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- **ComputeInstance API Enhancement ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103))**
  - Implemented explicit field types (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType) replacing JSON-encoded templateParameters
  - Added comprehensive validation rules (immutability via CEL, range constraints, enum validation)
  - Regenerated CRDs and DeepCopy code, all pre-commit checks pass (fmt, lint, UT)
  - Created test helper function and updated 35+ test fixtures across 5 controller test files
  - Deployed to vmaas-dev cluster successfully (operator rollout complete, CRD updated)
  - Created live test ComputeInstance with new API fields - CR validation working correctly
  - Identified provisioning failure requiring investigation of template parameter passing
- **Jobs Array Extension (Planning)**
  - Completed requirements gathering for extending jobs array pattern to ClusterOrder and HostPool
  - Conducted deep codebase exploration of both controllers and provider abstraction
  - Created comprehensive implementation plan (6 phases: worktree setup, schema updates, shared helpers, provider extensions, controller integration, configuration)
  - Designed hybrid approach for ClusterOrder (job tracking + HC watching) and polling approach for HostPool
  - Planned E2E test infrastructure with 4 new test files and helper modules

## Risks & Challenges
- **[MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) Provisioning Failure**: Test instance entered Failed state (Job ID 11885) - need to investigate how new structured fields are being passed to AAP/EDA templates and verify template compatibility

## Key Effort
Completing ComputeInstance API enhancement implementation and deployment, with active investigation into template parameter passing for new structured fields
