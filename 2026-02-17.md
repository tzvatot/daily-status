# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Implemented [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) - ComputeInstance API enhancement with explicit field types
  - Added 8 new structured fields (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType) replacing JSON-encoded templateParameters
  - Implemented immutability validation via CEL XValidation rules (all fields except runStrategy)
  - Created backward compatibility layer mapping new fields to legacy parameter names
  - Implemented runStrategy controller logic for VM stop/start operations
  - All 84 unit tests passing, live testing verified provisioning, immutability, and VM lifecycle
  - Created PR #111 ready for review
- Completed planning for Jobs Array Extension to ClusterOrder and HostPool resources
  - Deep analysis of existing controller implementations (watch-based vs fire-and-forget patterns)
  - Created comprehensive implementation plan with 6 phases and test infrastructure design
  - Identified shared code extraction opportunities (~300 lines reduction)
  - Documented backward compatibility strategy and risk mitigations

## Risks & Challenges
- ComputeInstance Phase shows "Running" when runStrategy=Halted (minor - VM state correctly reflected in VirtualMachine resource)
- Config version changes on runStrategy updates cause brief "Applying configuration" state (cosmetic - no re-provisioning occurs)
- E2E tests for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) still pending

## Key Effort
Implementing and validating explicit field types for ComputeInstance API with full backward compatibility
