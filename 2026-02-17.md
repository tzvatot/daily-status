# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Completed API implementation for ComputeInstance explicit field types ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103))
  - Added structured types: ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType
  - Implemented validation rules (immutability, required fields, value ranges)
  - Regenerated CRD with OpenAPI schema validation
  - Updated printer columns to show cores, memory, and runStrategy
- Implemented backward compatibility layer for template parameters
  - Created ensureBackwardCompatibility() function mapping new fields to legacy parameter names
  - Added comprehensive unit tests (84/84 passing)
  - Verified parameter mapping in AAP job logs
- Successfully deployed and tested new API on vmaas-dev cluster
  - Created git worktree and feature branch
  - Built and pushed container image to quay.io
  - Deployed operator with updated CRD
  - Tested successful VM provisioning with new API fields
  - Validated immutability enforcement for cores, memoryGiB, and image fields
  - Confirmed runStrategy field mutability
- Completed planning phase for Jobs Array Extension project
  - Analyzed ClusterOrder and HostPool controller implementations
  - Compared with ComputeInstance jobs array pattern
  - Created comprehensive implementation plan (merry-stargazing-graham.md)
  - Designed 6-phase implementation with backward compatibility
  - Planned E2E test infrastructure for osac-test-infra repo

## Risks & Challenges
- Controller logic for runStrategy runtime changes not yet implemented - field is mutable but changes don't propagate to VirtualMachine resource
- Need to implement VM start/stop functionality when runStrategy changes between Always and Halted

## Key Effort
Implementing and validating the ComputeInstance API enhancement with explicit field types, backward compatibility, and comprehensive testing
