# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Implemented [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) - ComputeInstance API Enhancement with explicit field types (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType)
- Added comprehensive API validation: immutability constraints (all fields except runStrategy), value ranges (cores: 1-128, memoryGiB: 1-1024), enum validation, and field requirements
- Updated CRD with OpenAPI schema validation and new printer columns (Template, Cores, Memory, RunStrategy, Phase)
- Created test helper function and updated 35+ test fixtures across 5 controller test files
- Regenerated DeepCopy code and CRD manifests - all unit tests passing (70+ tests), linter clean (0 issues)
- Deployed to vmaas-dev cluster - API validation working correctly, new fields accepted by CRD
- Created implementation plan for Jobs Array Extension to ClusterOrder and HostPool resources with provider abstraction support
- Completed deep analysis of ClusterOrder (watch-based lifecycle) and HostPool (fire-and-forget webhooks) controller patterns
- Designed hybrid approach for ClusterOrder (job tracking + HC watching) and polling approach for HostPool to replace fire-and-forget
- Planned test infrastructure with E2E tests in osac-test-infra repo (4 new test files with jobs assertions helper)

## Risks & Challenges
- ComputeInstance provisioning failing in vmaas-dev - Job ID 11885 entered Failed state, need to investigate if controller is correctly passing new structured fields to AAP/EDA templates
- Templates may still expect deprecated `templateParameters` JSON string format instead of explicit fields - backward compatibility concern

## Key Effort
Implementing and deploying ComputeInstance API enhancement with explicit typed fields, currently debugging provisioning integration with AAP/EDA templates.
