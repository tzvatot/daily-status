# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Completed [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) - ComputeInstance API Enhancement with explicit field types (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType)
- Implemented backward compatibility for existing templates via `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` function
- Implemented `syncRunStrategy()` controller logic for VM stop/start functionality
- Created comprehensive unit tests (84/84 passing) for ComputeInstance API changes
- Created E2E test suite for ComputeInstance API fields validation and runStrategy functionality
- Submitted PR #111 for ComputeInstance API enhancement to osac-operator
- Completed full implementation of Jobs Array Extension for ClusterOrder and HostPool resources
- Created shared job helper functions package reducing code duplication by ~150 lines
- Fixed critical bug in EDA provider - extended from 2 to 6 webhook URLs for resource-specific routing
- Submitted draft PR #110 for Jobs Array Extension to osac-operator
- Successfully deployed and validated changes in vmaas-dev cluster

## Risks & Challenges
- ComputeInstance Phase doesn't reflect stopped state when runStrategy=Halted (documented as future work)
- Config version changes trigger brief "Applying configuration" state when runStrategy changes (cosmetic issue, future improvement)

## Key Effort
Implementing and validating API enhancements for ComputeInstance explicit fields and extending jobs array pattern to ClusterOrder and HostPool resources with full backward compatibility.
