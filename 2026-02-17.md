# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- **API Implementation Complete**: Implemented enhancement proposal #21 for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) - added explicit field types to ComputeInstance API (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType) replacing JSON-encoded templateParameters with structured, typed fields
- **Validation & Testing**: All validation rules implemented (immutability, ranges, enums), CRD regenerated, linter passes with 0 issues, all 70+ unit tests passing
- **Deployment Complete**: Code committed, pushed to fork, validated, containerized (quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-8818ff6), and deployed to vmaas-dev cluster
- **Live API Testing**: Successfully created test ComputeInstance with new API fields - API validation working, printer columns displaying new fields (Cores, Memory, RunStrategy)
- **Jobs Array Planning**: Completed comprehensive planning for extending jobs array pattern from ComputeInstance to ClusterOrder and HostPool resources - detailed implementation plan created covering 6 phases with backward compatibility and hybrid approach for ClusterOrder

## Risks & Challenges
- **Provisioning Failure Investigation**: Test ComputeInstance entered Failed state (Job 11885) - need to investigate how new structured fields are being passed to templates and whether controller serialization requires updates to handle explicit fields vs. deprecated templateParameters

## Key Effort
Implementing and deploying ComputeInstance API enhancements with explicit field types while planning jobs array extension across all provisioning resources
