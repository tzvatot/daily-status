# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Implemented API enhancement for ComputeInstance ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)) with explicit typed fields (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType)
- Added CEL-based validation rules enforcing immutability for cores, memoryGiB, image, bootDisk, additionalDisks, userDataSecretRef, and sshKey fields
- Implemented backward compatibility layer mapping new fields to legacy template parameters
- Developed runStrategy controller logic enabling VM stop/start functionality
- Created comprehensive unit tests (84/84 passing) covering API types, backward compatibility, and edge cases
- Successfully deployed and tested implementation on vmaas-dev cluster with live VM provisioning
- Verified immutability validation through live kubectl patch tests
- Tested runStrategy runtime changes (Always→Halted→Always) with VM state synchronization
- Created pull request [#111](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/111) with 4 commits (8818ff6, 7a79e6e, 3381040, 3901d35)
- Developed E2E test suite in osac-test-infra covering runStrategy mutability and immutability validation (5 comprehensive tests)
- Completed planning for Jobs Array Extension project with detailed implementation plan covering ClusterOrder and HostPool resources

## Risks & Challenges
- ComputeInstance Phase doesn't reflect stopped state when runStrategy=Halted (future work needed)
- Config version changes when runStrategy is modified causing brief "Applying configuration" state (cosmetic issue for future improvement)

## Key Effort
Completed full implementation and testing of ComputeInstance API enhancement [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) including API schema, validation, backward compatibility, controller logic, and comprehensive test coverage.
