# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Implemented ComputeInstance API enhancement ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)) with explicit typed fields (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType) replacing JSON-encoded templateParameters
- Added comprehensive validation rules: immutability enforcement for all fields except runStrategy, value range validation (cores: 1-128, memoryGiB: 1-1024), required field validation
- Implemented backward compatibility layer mapping new structured fields to legacy template parameter names (cores→cpu_cores, memoryGiB→memory, etc.)
- Created 84 passing unit tests covering API types, parameter mapping, precedence rules, and edge cases
- Deployed to vmaas-dev cluster and verified successful provisioning with new API fields - Job 11967 succeeded, VirtualMachine running with IP 10.200.0.10
- Validated immutability constraints through live testing - confirmed cores, memoryGiB, and image fields properly reject modification attempts
- Verified AAP job logs show correct parameter translation from new API format to legacy template expectations
- Updated printer columns for kubectl output to display cores, memory, and runStrategy fields
- Completed comprehensive planning for Jobs Array Extension project covering ClusterOrder and HostPool resources with hybrid approach design

## Risks & Challenges
- Discovered runStrategy controller logic gap: while API correctly allows field mutation, controller doesn't propagate changes to underlying VirtualMachine.spec.running field - requires additional implementation beyond API schema changes
- Need to implement controller logic to detect runStrategy changes and trigger VM start/stop operations via KubeVirt

## Key Effort
Implementing and testing ComputeInstance API enhancement with explicit typed fields, backward compatibility, and immutability validation
