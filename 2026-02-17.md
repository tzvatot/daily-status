# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments

- Completed OSAC Operator ComputeInstance API Enhancement ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103))
  - Implemented new structured fields (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType) to replace JSON-encoded templateParameters
  - Added CEL XValidation rules for immutability enforcement (cores, memory, image, disks immutable; runStrategy mutable)
  - Implemented backward compatibility layer mapping new fields to legacy template parameter names
  - Implemented runStrategy controller logic for VM stop/start functionality
  - Created comprehensive unit tests (84/84 passing) and E2E test playbooks
  - Fixed deprovision bug - ensured templateParameters generated before cleanup
  - Fixed controller test failures and corrected import paths across 61 files
  - Successfully deployed and validated on vmaas-dev cluster
  - Pull request created and ready for review: https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/111

- Completed OSAC Operator Jobs Array Extension implementation
  - Extended jobs array pattern from ComputeInstance to ClusterOrder and HostPool resources
  - Created shared job helpers package to eliminate code duplication (~150 lines)
  - Extended AAP and EDA providers with resource-specific parameter extraction and webhook handling
  - Fixed critical EDA provider bug - implemented resource-specific webhook URLs (6 URLs for 3 resource types)
  - Integrated job tracking into ClusterOrder controller (hybrid approach: job tracking + HC watching)
  - Integrated job tracking into HostPool controller (replaced fire-and-forget with job polling)
  - Implemented single shared provider configuration for all resource types
  - All unit tests passing (70.8% provisioning package coverage)
  - Pull request created (draft): https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/110

## Risks & Challenges

- ComputeInstance Phase doesn't reflect "Stopped" state when runStrategy=Halted (future enhancement needed)
- Jobs array extension requires comprehensive E2E testing before production deployment
- Import path changes require careful coordination during deployment (github.com/osac/osac-operator → github.com/osac-project/osac-operator)

## Key Effort

Implemented structured API fields for ComputeInstance and extended jobs array pattern to ClusterOrder/HostPool for improved consistency and observability across all OSAC provisioning resources.
