# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Completed API implementation for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) - ComputeInstance API Enhancement
  - Added structured typed fields (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType) to replace JSON-encoded templateParameters
  - Implemented comprehensive validation (immutability, value ranges, enums) via XValidation CEL rules
  - Updated all controller test fixtures (5 test files, 35+ usages) and added unit tests
  - Regenerated CRD with OpenAPI schema and DeepCopy code
  - All unit tests passing (70+ controller tests), linter clean (0 issues)
- Deployed [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) changes to vmaas-dev cluster
  - Created git worktree and feature branch
  - Built and pushed container image to quay.io
  - Successfully deployed operator with updated CRD
  - Created test ComputeInstance using new API fields - API validation working correctly
- Completed planning for Jobs Array Extension project
  - Deep analysis of ClusterOrder and HostPool controller implementations
  - Created comprehensive implementation plan (`merry-stargazing-graham.md`)
  - Designed hybrid approach (job tracking + HC watching for ClusterOrder)
  - Planned test infrastructure with E2E tests in osac-test-infra repo

## Risks & Challenges
- [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) provisioning failure during testing - ComputeInstance entered Failed state (Job ID 11885)
  - Need to investigate how new structured fields are being passed to AAP/EDA templates
  - Templates may still expect templateParameters JSON format instead of explicit fields
  - Requires controller log analysis and template configuration verification

## Key Effort
API enhancement implementation and deployment for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) with comprehensive testing infrastructure and validation
