# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Completed API implementation for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) - Added explicit field types to ComputeInstance API including ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType enum, and structured fields (image, cores, memoryGiB, bootDisk, additionalDisks, runStrategy, userDataSecretRef, sshKey)
- Implemented comprehensive validation rules with immutability constraints (all fields except runStrategy) using CEL XValidation rules
- Regenerated CRD with updated OpenAPI schema and printer columns showing Template, Cores, Memory, RunStrategy, Phase
- Updated 35+ test fixtures across 5 controller test files and created newTestComputeInstanceSpec() helper function
- Passed all quality gates: code formatting, linter (0 issues), and 70+ unit tests
- Deployed to vmaas-dev cluster successfully via git worktree, created test ComputeInstance validating new API fields work correctly
- Completed requirements gathering and deep codebase analysis for Jobs Array Extension project covering ClusterOrder and HostPool resources
- Created comprehensive implementation plan (merry-stargazing-graham.md) with 6 phases covering schema updates, shared helper extraction, provider extensions, and controller integration

## Risks & Challenges
- ComputeInstance test deployment reached Failed phase (Job ID 11885) - requires investigation of how new structured fields are being serialized and passed to AAP/EDA templates versus legacy templateParameters format
- Potential backward compatibility issue where templates may still expect JSON-encoded templateParameters instead of explicit fields

## Key Effort
Implementing ComputeInstance API enhancement to replace JSON-encoded templateParameters with strongly-typed structured fields and investigating provisioning failure in test deployment
