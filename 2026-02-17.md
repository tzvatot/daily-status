# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Completed ComputeInstance API enhancement implementation ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103))
  - Added structured typed fields (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType) to replace JSON-encoded templateParameters
  - Implemented validation rules (immutability, value ranges, enum constraints)
  - Updated CRD, regenerated code, all unit tests passing (70+ tests)
  - Updated all controller test fixtures across 5 test files
- Deployed [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) implementation to vmaas-dev cluster
  - Created git worktree, committed, pushed to fork
  - Built container image, deployed operator successfully
  - CRD updated on cluster
- Created comprehensive implementation plan for Jobs Array Extension project
  - Analyzed ClusterOrder and HostPool controller patterns
  - Designed hybrid approach (job tracking + HC watching for ClusterOrder)
  - Planned extraction of shared job helpers, provider extensions, E2E tests
  - Documented 6 implementation phases with backward compatibility strategy

## Risks & Challenges
- ComputeInstance provisioning failing after deployment - Job 11885 failed, need to investigate how new structured fields are passed to AAP/EDA templates
- Template may still expect old templateParameters format instead of new explicit fields
- Requires log analysis and template configuration verification before proceeding with PR

## Key Effort
API enhancement implementation and deployment testing for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103), with parallel planning for Jobs Array Extension across ClusterOrder and HostPool resources.
