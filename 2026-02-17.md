# Daily Status - 2026-02-17

## Accomplishments
- Successfully completed [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) - ComputeInstance API enhancement to replace JSON-encoded templateParameters with structured, typed fields (ImageSpec, DiskSpec, RunStrategyType)
- Implemented comprehensive API validation with CEL rules (all fields immutable except runStrategy, range validation for cores 1-128 and memoryGiB 1-1024)
- Regenerated CRDs and DeepCopy code, updated 10 files including controller test fixtures (35+ usages across 5 test files)
- All checks passed: code formatting, linter (0 issues), unit tests (70 controller tests + API tests), integration tests
- Created comprehensive implementation plan for extending jobs array pattern from ComputeInstance to ClusterOrder and HostPool resources
- Completed deep codebase exploration of ClusterOrder (watch-based lifecycle) and HostPool (fire-and-forget webhooks) controllers
- Designed hybrid approach for ClusterOrder (job tracking + HC watching) and polling-based approach for HostPool to replace fire-and-forget pattern
- Planned test infrastructure with 4 new E2E test files in osac-test-infra repo and git worktree strategy for concurrent development

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Completed ComputeInstance API enhancement with full validation and testing, and created detailed implementation plan for extending jobs array pattern to ClusterOrder and HostPool resources.
