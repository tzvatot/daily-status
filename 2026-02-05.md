# Daily Status - 2026-02-05

## Accomplishments
- Deployed operator with job cancellation support (commit 09f753e) to vmaas-dev namespace
- Created E2E test playbook `test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml` to verify cancellation logic
- Discovered critical architectural issue: AAP finalizers incompatible with fulfillment-cli workflow
- Implemented provider-aware deletion flow removing AAP finalizer dependency for Direct provider ([MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880))
- Fixed status polling bug during cancellation - controller now polls AAP instead of using cached status (commit b1e97fc)
- Fixed optimistic concurrency conflict causing duplicate deprovision jobs - implemented `retry.RetryOnConflict()` in Reconcile loop (commit e0a1c3d)
- All 57 unit and integration tests passing
- Deployed retry fix (commit e0a1c3d) to vmaas-dev namespace

## Risks & Challenges
- E2E testing revealed multiple race conditions requiring iterative fixes (status polling, optimistic concurrency)
- Architectural decision to remove AAP finalizers differs from EDA flow - requires verification that deletion properly blocks on deprovision completion

## Key Effort
Fixing AAP provisioning deletion flow to properly cancel provision jobs and prevent concurrent/duplicate deprovision jobs through provider-aware logic and retry mechanisms.
