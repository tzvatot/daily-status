# Daily Status - 2026-02-05

## Accomplishments
- Deployed and tested AAP provisioning job cancellation integration (commit 09f753e)
- Created E2E test playbook `test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml` to validate deletion-during-provisioning flow
- Discovered and fixed critical finalizer architecture issue - removed AAP finalizer dependency for Direct provider flow, implementing provider-aware deletion logic (commit d2d886c)
- Fixed provision job status polling bug during deletion - controller now polls AAP instead of relying on cached status (commit b1e97fc)
- Fixed duplicate deprovision job triggers caused by optimistic concurrency conflicts - implemented `retry.RetryOnConflict()` with status update retry mechanism (commit e0a1c3d)
- Fixed CRD validation rejection of "Canceled" job state - added to job status enums and regenerated manifests (commit f63b908)
- Successfully validated complete deletion flow through E2E testing - verified job cancellation, single deprovision job, clean resource deletion, and no orphaned VMs
- Work tracked under [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880)
