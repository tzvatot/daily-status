# Daily Status - 2026-02-05

## Accomplishments
- Deployed cloudkit-operator with job cancellation support (commit 09f753e) to vmaas-dev namespace
- Created E2E test playbook for testing deletion during provisioning ([MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880))
- Discovered and resolved fundamental AAP finalizer architecture incompatibility between EDA and AAP Direct flows
- Implemented provider-aware deletion flow with proper cancellation and deprovision handling (commit d2d886c)
- All 57 unit and integration tests passing after refactor
- Fixed status polling bug during cancellation - controller now polls AAP instead of trusting cached status (commit b1e97fc)
- Fixed optimistic concurrency bug causing duplicate deprovision jobs - implemented `retry.RetryOnConflict()` in reconcile loop (commit e0a1c3d)
- Built and deployed final operator image with all fixes to vmaas-dev namespace

## Risks & Challenges
Discovered that AAP finalizers were designed for EDA's webhook-based flow and are incompatible with AAP Direct provider workflow where controller has full lifecycle control via REST API. Required architectural change to support fulfillment-cli created resources.

## Key Effort
Testing and fixing AAP provisioning integration cancellation logic, resolving status polling and concurrency bugs.
