# Daily Status - 2026-02-05

## Accomplishments
- Deployed operator with job cancellation support from commit `09f753e` to vmaas-dev namespace
- Created comprehensive E2E test (`test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml`) to validate deletion during provisioning workflow
- Discovered critical architectural issue: AAP finalizer dependency blocked fulfillment-cli workflows in AAP Direct provider flow
- Implemented provider-aware deletion flow (commit `d2d886c`) removing AAP finalizer dependency for Direct provider
- Added provider type constants (`ProviderTypeEDA`, `ProviderTypeAAP`) to cleanly distinguish provider behavior
- Updated deletion logic: AAP Direct blocks on deprovision failure to prevent orphaned resources, EDA allows deletion to proceed
- Verified all 57 unit and integration tests passing after architectural changes
- Built and deployed new operator image (`quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:aap-provisioning-d2d886c`) to vmaas-dev
- Working on [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880)

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Resolved AAP finalizer architecture mismatch preventing proper job cancellation during ComputeInstance deletion in AAP Direct provisioning flow.
