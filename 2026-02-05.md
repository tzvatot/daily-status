# Daily Status - 2026-02-05

## Accomplishments
- Deployed cloudkit-operator with AAP job cancellation support (commit [09f753e](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880))
- Created E2E test playbook for deletion-during-provisioning validation (`test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml`)
- Discovered and fixed critical finalizer architecture issue - removed AAP finalizer dependency for Direct provider flow (commit d2d886c)
- Fixed provision job status polling bug during deletion (commit b1e97fc)
- Fixed duplicate deprovision job issue by implementing optimistic concurrency retry mechanism (commit e0a1c3d)
- Added "Canceled" state to CRD job status enums (commit f63b908)
- Validated all fixes through successful E2E test - provision job canceled cleanly before deprovision, no orphaned resources
- Created comprehensive test documentation (518 lines) with detailed flow analysis and results
- Generated 4 PlantUML architecture diagrams (Component, Creation Sequence, Deletion Sequence for AAP Direct and EDA models)
- All 57 unit and integration tests passing
- Deployed final image: `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:aap-provisioning-f63b908`

## Risks & Challenges
- Need comprehensive test coverage for all AAP job states (Pending, Running, Succeeded, Failed, Canceled)
- Need to identify and validate error scenarios and edge cases
- Commits ready but not yet pushed to remote
- JIRA not yet updated with progress

## Key Effort
Architected and implemented provider-aware deletion flow for AAP Direct integration, removing finalizer dependency and fixing race conditions through status polling and optimistic concurrency handling.
