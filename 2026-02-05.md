# Daily Status - 2026-02-05

## Accomplishments
- Deployed operator with job cancellation support (commit 09f753e)
- Created E2E test for deletion during provisioning workflow
- Discovered and fixed fundamental architecture issue: removed AAP finalizer dependency for Direct provider flow
- Implemented provider-aware deletion flow distinguishing EDA vs AAP Direct behavior
- Fixed status polling bug during cancellation (controller was checking cached status instead of polling AAP)
- Fixed race condition causing duplicate deprovision jobs by implementing optimistic concurrency retry mechanism
- Deployed final version with all fixes (commit e0a1c3d) - all 57 tests passing
- Work tracked in [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880)

## Risks & Challenges
E2E testing revealed multiple concurrency issues that required iterative fixes:
- AAP finalizer architecture incompatible with fulfillment-cli workflow
- Status caching during cancellation causing stale reads
- Optimistic concurrency conflicts during status updates leading to duplicate job creation

## Key Effort
Fixed critical architectural issues in AAP Direct provisioning deletion flow, eliminating finalizer dependencies and implementing proper concurrency handling for job cancellation and status updates.
