# Daily Status - 2026-02-05

## Accomplishments
- Deployed operator with job cancellation support (commit 09f753e)
- Created E2E test for deletion during provisioning
- Discovered and resolved fundamental architecture issue: AAP finalizers incompatible with AAP Direct flow (fulfillment-cli creates resources without AAP finalizers)
- Implemented provider-aware deletion flow distinguishing EDA vs AAP Direct behavior
- Fixed critical status polling bug: controller now polls AAP for current job state instead of using cached status during cancellation
- Fixed duplicate deprovision job bug: implemented optimistic concurrency retry mechanism using `retry.RetryOnConflict()` with exponential backoff
- All unit and integration tests passing (57/57)
- Built and deployed 3 operator versions with iterative bug fixes:
  - `09f753e` (initial cancellation support)
  - `d2d886c` (provider-aware deletion, no finalizer dependency)
  - `b1e97fc` (status polling fix)
  - `e0a1c3d` (optimistic concurrency handling)
- Working on [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880) (AAP Provisioning Abstraction)

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Fixed AAP Direct provider deletion flow to properly cancel provision jobs and handle concurrent status updates without creating duplicate deprovision jobs.
