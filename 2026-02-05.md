# Daily Status - 2026-02-05

## Accomplishments
- Verified and deployed cancellation implementation (commit 09f753e) to vmaas-dev namespace
- Created E2E test playbook for deletion-during-provisioning workflow validation
- Discovered and fixed critical architectural issue: removed AAP finalizer dependency for Direct provider flow ([MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880))
- Implemented provider-aware deletion flow (EDA vs AAP Direct) with proper resource cleanup blocking
- Fixed status polling bug during deletion - controller now polls AAP API instead of trusting cached status (commit b1e97fc)
- Fixed duplicate deprovision job bug by implementing retry.RetryOnConflict() for status updates (commit e0a1c3d)
- Fixed CRD validation by adding "Canceled" state to job status enums (commit f63b908)
- Successfully completed final E2E test - validated provision job cancellation, single deprovision job, no orphaned VMs
- Deployed final working image: quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:aap-provisioning-f63b908
- All 57 unit and integration tests passing
