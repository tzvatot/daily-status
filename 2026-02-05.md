# Daily Status - 2026-02-05

## Accomplishments
- Deployed cloudkit-operator with job cancellation support (commit 09f753e) to vmaas-dev namespace
- Created E2E test for deletion during provisioning (`test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml`)
- Discovered architectural issue: AAP finalizer blocks fulfillment-cli workflows and is unnecessary for AAP Direct provider
- Implemented provider-aware deletion flow (EDA vs AAP Direct) - commit d2d886c with all 57 tests passing
- Fixed status polling bug during cancellation - controller now calls AAP for current state instead of using cached status (commit b1e97fc)
- Fixed duplicate deprovision job bug caused by optimistic concurrency conflicts - implemented `retry.RetryOnConflict()` in reconcile loop (commit e0a1c3d)
- Deployed final fixes to vmaas-dev namespace (`quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:aap-provisioning-e0a1c3d`)
- Related: [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880)

## Risks & Challenges
- Multiple test iterations required to discover race conditions (status polling, optimistic concurrency)
- Architectural assumption (AAP finalizer) from EDA flow was incompatible with AAP Direct provider

## Key Effort
Fixed race conditions and architectural issues in AAP Direct provider deletion flow to prevent orphaned resources and duplicate jobs.
