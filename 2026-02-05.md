# Daily Status - 2026-02-05

## Accomplishments
- Deployed operator with job cancellation support (commit 09f753e) to vmaas-dev namespace
- Created E2E test `test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml` to validate deletion during provisioning workflow
- Discovered critical architectural issue: AAP finalizer designed for EDA webhook flow conflicts with AAP Direct REST API control
- Implemented provider-aware deletion flow (commit d2d886c) distinguishing EDA and AAP Direct provider behaviors
- Removed AAP finalizer dependency for Direct provider - controller now manages full lifecycle via REST API
- Fixed deletion logic: AAP Direct blocks on deprovision failure to prevent orphaned resources; EDA allows deletion to proceed
- All 57 unit and integration tests passing after refactor
- Built and deployed new image (`quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:aap-provisioning-d2d886c`) to vmaas-dev
- Working on [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880)

## Risks & Challenges
None - architectural issue resolved and all tests passing. Ready for E2E validation.

## Key Effort
Discovered and fixed fundamental architectural mismatch between EDA finalizer-based flow and AAP Direct REST API control, enabling proper provision job cancellation during resource deletion.
