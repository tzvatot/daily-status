# Daily Status - 2026-02-05

## Accomplishments
- Deployed cloudkit-operator with AAP job cancellation support (commits [09f753e](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880), d2d886c)
- Created E2E test `playbooks/test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml` to validate deletion-during-provisioning flow
- Discovered and fixed architectural issue: removed AAP finalizer dependency for Direct provider flow (works with fulfillment-cli workflow)
- Fixed status polling bug during deletion - controller now polls AAP for current state instead of using cached status (commit b1e97fc)
- Fixed duplicate deprovision job issue by implementing optimistic concurrency retry mechanism with `retry.RetryOnConflict()` (commit e0a1c3d)
- Added "Canceled" state to CRD job status enums and regenerated manifests (commit f63b908)
- Successfully validated all fixes with final E2E test - provision job properly canceled before deprovision, no duplicate jobs, no orphaned VMs, clean deletion (test passed with exit code 0)
- Deployed final working image: `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:aap-provisioning-f63b908`
- Related work: [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880)

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Testing and debugging AAP provisioning deletion flow, fixing race conditions and architectural issues with finalizers and concurrent job handling.
