# Daily Status - 2026-02-05

## Accomplishments
- Deployed operator with job cancellation support (commit 09f753e) and verified implementation
- Created E2E test playbook for validating deletion-during-provisioning scenarios
- Discovered and resolved fundamental architecture issue: AAP finalizers incompatible with AAP Direct provider flow (designed for EDA webhook flow only)
- Implemented provider-aware deletion logic distinguishing EDA vs AAP Direct flows (commit d2d886c)
- Fixed critical bug in cancellation flow: controller now polls AAP for current job status instead of relying on cached state (commit b1e97fc)
- Fixed optimistic concurrency bug preventing duplicate deprovision jobs by implementing retry mechanism with exponential backoff (commit e0a1c3d)
- All unit and integration tests passing (57/57)
- Built and deployed 3 operator images during iterative testing: 09f753e, d2d886c, e0a1c3d
- Related to [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880)

## Risks & Challenges
- E2E testing revealed multiple edge cases requiring fixes (cancellation status polling, optimistic concurrency conflicts)
- Architectural mismatch between EDA and AAP Direct flows required careful provider-type handling to maintain backward compatibility
- Still pending: final E2E validation of retry fix to confirm no duplicate deprovision jobs

## Key Effort
Debugging and fixing AAP Direct provider deletion flow to properly handle job cancellation during provisioning and prevent race conditions.
