# Daily Status - 2026-02-05

## Accomplishments
- Deployed cloudkit-operator with job cancellation support (commit 09f753e)
- Created E2E test playbook for deletion during provisioning workflow
- Discovered and resolved fundamental AAP finalizer architecture mismatch between EDA and Direct provider flows
- Implemented provider-aware deletion flow with proper deprovision blocking for AAP Direct provider (commit d2d886c)
- Fixed status polling bug during job cancellation - controller now polls AAP API instead of using stale cached status (commit b1e97fc)
- Fixed race condition causing duplicate deprovision jobs by implementing optimistic concurrency retry mechanism with `retry.RetryOnConflict()` (commit e0a1c3d)
- All unit and integration tests passing (57/57)
- Deployed final operator image with all fixes to vmaas-dev namespace
- Related to [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880) - AAP Provisioning Abstraction

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Fixed critical race conditions and architectural issues in cloudkit-operator AAP Direct provider deletion flow, implementing proper job cancellation, status polling, and optimistic concurrency handling.
