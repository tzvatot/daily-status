# Daily Status - 2026-02-05

## Accomplishments
- Deployed cloudkit-operator with job cancellation support ([MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880) commit 09f753e)
- Created E2E test for deletion during provisioning workflow
- Discovered and resolved fundamental AAP finalizer architecture issue (finalizers incompatible with AAP Direct flow)
- Implemented provider-aware deletion flow distinguishing EDA vs AAP Direct models
- Fixed status polling bug during deletion (controller checked cache instead of polling AAP)
- Fixed duplicate deprovision job bug with optimistic concurrency retry mechanism
- Added "Canceled" state to CRD job status enums
- Successfully validated complete deletion-during-provisioning flow (provision job 4870 canceled, deprovision job 4872 succeeded, no orphaned resources)
- Created comprehensive test documentation (518 lines) with architecture overview and detailed test results
- Generated UML diagrams: Component architecture, AAP Direct creation/deletion sequences, EDA deletion flow
- Analyzed codebase and documented 21 test scenarios across job states, error handling, and edge cases
- All unit and integration tests passing (57/57)
- Deployed final image: quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:aap-provisioning-f63b908

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Implementing and validating robust deletion-during-provisioning flow for AAP Direct provider with proper job cancellation, status polling, and duplicate job prevention.
