# Daily Status - 2026-02-05

## Accomplishments

- Verified job cancellation implementation (commit 09f753e) and deployed to vmaas-dev namespace
- Created E2E test playbook for deletion-during-provisioning scenario with validation criteria (provision job cancellation, no concurrent jobs, clean deletion)
- Discovered critical architecture issue: AAP finalizer from EDA flow incompatible with AAP Direct provider (blocked cancellation/deprovision logic in fulfillment-cli workflows)
- Designed and implemented provider-aware deletion flow removing AAP finalizer dependency for Direct provider (commit d2d886c)
- Updated deletion logic: AAP Direct blocks on deprovision failure (prevents orphaned resources), EDA allows deletion (webhook owns cleanup)
- Fixed all unit and integration tests (57/57 passing) after finalizer removal
- Built and deployed new operator image (d2d886c) to vmaas-dev with provider-aware deletion flow

## Risks & Challenges

Critical architectural mismatch discovered between EDA finalizer pattern and AAP Direct REST API control. AAP finalizer was blocking cancellation/deprovision logic when resources created by fulfillment-cli (which doesn't add AAP finalizers). Issue resolved by implementing provider-specific deletion flows.

## Key Effort

Discovered and resolved AAP finalizer incompatibility between EDA webhook flow and AAP Direct REST API control, enabling proper job cancellation and clean deletion for fulfillment-cli workflows.
