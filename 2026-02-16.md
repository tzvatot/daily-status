# Daily Status - 2026-02-16

## Accomplishments

- Drafted comprehensive responses to Avishay's review comments on [PR #20](https://github.com/osac-project/docs/pull/20) (AAP provisioning documentation)
  - Explained polling mechanism rationale: state-based reconciliation survives operator crashes, network partitions; WebSocket/webhook events lost if operator down
  - Clarified CR status in etcd as source of truth; explained K8s API callback challenges (authentication, coupling, still needs reconciliation fallback)
  - Acknowledged playbook modularity suggestion as valuable future enhancement (Ansible role composition for CSP-specific network/storage)
- Completed cleanup of 49 ComputeInstances from vmaas-dev namespace (parallel deletion with `xargs -P 10`, ~6 minutes total)
- Cleaned up 6 orphaned VMs from vmaas-dev-uckczjzmz3f5c namespace (leftover from failed deprovision jobs, no corresponding ComputeInstances)
- Validated AAP Direct provider's `BlockDeletionOnFailure` design through real-world orphaned resource example

## Risks & Challenges

## Key Effort

Addressing architectural review feedback on AAP provisioning documentation and completing environment cleanup validation
