# Daily Status - 2026-02-16

## Accomplishments

- Drafted comprehensive responses to Avishay's review comments on [PR #20](https://github.com/osac-project/docs/pull/20) (AAP provisioning documentation):
  - Explained polling mechanism choice (state-based reconciliation vs event-based approaches, eventual consistency guarantees)
  - Clarified state management architecture (etcd as source of truth, explained callback approach tradeoffs)
  - Addressed modular provisioning suggestion (Ansible role composition patterns, documented as future enhancement)
- Completed cleanup of 49 ComputeInstances from vmaas-dev namespace (parallel deletion in ~6 minutes)
- Cleaned up 6 orphaned VMs from vmaas-dev-uckczjzmz3f5c namespace (real-world validation of `BlockDeletionOnFailure` feature design)
- Updated daily status files and committed changes
