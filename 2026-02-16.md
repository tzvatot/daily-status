# Daily Status - 2026-02-16

## Accomplishments

- Drafted comprehensive responses to Avishay's review comments on [PR #20](https://github.com/osac-project/docs/pull/20) (AAP provisioning documentation)
  - Explained polling mechanism rationale: state-based reconciliation survives operator restarts/network failures, AWX WebSocket/webhook features not officially supported in AAP
  - Addressed state management concerns: CR status in etcd is source of truth, K8s API callbacks feasible but don't eliminate need for reconciliation
  - Responded to modular provisioning suggestion: acknowledged playbook-level modularity vision, suggested documenting as future enhancement
- Completed cleanup of 49 ComputeInstances from vmaas-dev namespace (parallel deletion in ~6 minutes)
- Cleaned up 6 orphaned VMs from vmaas-dev-uckczjzmz3f5c namespace (leftover from failed deprovision jobs)
- Validated real-world orphaned resource problem, demonstrating value of AAP Direct provider's `BlockDeletionOnFailure` feature
