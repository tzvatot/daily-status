# Daily Status - 2026-02-16

## Accomplishments

- Drafted comprehensive responses to Avishay's review comments on [PR #20](https://github.com/osac-project/docs/pull/20) covering polling mechanisms, state management, and modular provisioning approaches
- Completed cleanup of 49 ComputeInstances from vmaas-dev namespace (parallel deletion in ~6 minutes)
- Cleaned up 6 orphaned VMs from vmaas-dev-uckczjzmz3f5c namespace, validating the need for AAP Direct's `BlockDeletionOnFailure` feature
- Updated osac-test-infra to align with [MGMT-22638](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22638) ComputeInstance phase renames (Ready → Running, 9 occurrences)
- Successfully validated phase state updates with AAP Direct provider E2E testing (all 40 tasks passed)
- Merged [PR #12](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-test-infra/pull/12) adding E2E test for ComputeInstance deletion during provisioning
- Restructured AAP provisioning documentation, reducing README.md from 1,617 to 351 lines (78% reduction) by splitting into focused docs (operations.md, testing.md, troubleshooting.md)
- Implemented repository rename from innabox/cloudkit-operator to osac/osac-operator for [MGMT-22671](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22671) (154 files updated, all tests passing)
- Created [PR #108](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/108) with detailed migration documentation and preserved backwards compatibility
