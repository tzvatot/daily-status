# Daily Status - 2026-02-16

## Accomplishments

- Drafted comprehensive responses to Avishay's review comments on PR #20 (AAP provisioning documentation):
  - Polling mechanism: Explained state-based reconciliation pattern, eventual consistency guarantees, and why WebSocket/webhook alternatives aren't reliable for crash recovery
  - State management: Clarified CR status in etcd as source of truth, evaluated AAP → K8s API callback approach and its trade-offs (auth complexity, coupling, still requires polling fallback)
  - Modular provisioning: Acknowledged playbook-level modularity vision for CSP-customizable network/storage roles
- Completed cleanup of 49 ComputeInstances from vmaas-dev namespace (parallel deletion with `xargs -P 10`, completed in ~6 minutes)
- Cleaned up 6 orphaned VMs from vmaas-dev-uckczjzmz3f5c namespace (leftover from failed deprovision jobs, no corresponding ComputeInstances)
- Validated real-world orphaned resource problem, demonstrating value of AAP Direct provider's `BlockDeletionOnFailure` feature
- Updated daily status files and committed changes
