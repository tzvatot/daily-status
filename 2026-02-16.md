# Daily Status - 2026-02-16

## Accomplishments

1. Drafted comprehensive responses to Avishay's PR review comments on [PR #20](https://github.com/osac-project/docs/pull/20) (AAP provisioning documentation)
   - Explained polling mechanism design (state-based vs event-based reconciliation)
   - Clarified K8s CR status as source of truth with callback feasibility analysis
   - Acknowledged playbook modularity as valuable future enhancement
2. Completed cleanup of 49 ComputeInstances from vmaas-dev namespace (parallel deletion with `xargs -P 10`)
3. Cleaned up 6 orphaned VMs from vmaas-dev-uckczjzmz3f5c namespace (real-world validation of AAP Direct `BlockDeletionOnFailure` feature)
4. Updated osac-test-infra to align with upstream ComputeInstance phase state renames (Ready → Running, 9 occurrences across 2 test roles)
5. Validated E2E test infrastructure with AAP Direct provider (40 tasks passed, 0 failures, ComputeInstance vm-qhq67 full lifecycle)
6. Merged [PR #12](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-test-infra/pull/12) to osac-test-infra (E2E test for deletion during provisioning + phase state updates)
7. Restructured AAP provisioning documentation from 1,617 lines to 4 focused documents (README.md: 351 lines, operations.md: 388 lines, testing.md: 289 lines, troubleshooting.md: 293 lines - 78% reduction in main doc)
8. Implemented repository rename for MGMT-22671 (innabox/cloudkit-operator → osac/osac-operator, 154 files changed, all tests passing)
9. Created [PR #108](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/108) for repository rename with preserved backwards compatibility for external APIs

## Risks & Challenges
