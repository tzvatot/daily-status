  - Discussed playbook modularity vision for CSP-provided custom network/storage modules
- Completed cleanup of 49 ComputeInstances from vmaas-dev namespace (parallel deletion completed in ~6 minutes)
- Cleaned up 6 orphaned VMs from vmaas-dev-uckczjzmz3f5c namespace (real-world validation of `BlockDeletionOnFailure` feature value)
