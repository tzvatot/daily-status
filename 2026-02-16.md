# Daily Status - 2026-02-16

## Accomplishments

1. Drafted comprehensive responses to Avishay's review comments on [PR #20](https://github.com/osac-project/docs/pull/20) (AAP provisioning documentation)
   - Addressed polling mechanism concerns (WebSocket/webhook alternatives vs eventual consistency)
   - Explained state management approach (etcd as source of truth vs AAP callbacks)
   - Discussed modular provisioning vision (playbook-level CSP customization)

2. Completed environment cleanup
   - Deleted 49 ComputeInstances from vmaas-dev namespace
   - Cleaned up 6 orphaned VMs from vmaas-dev-uckczjzmz3f5c namespace
   - Validated real-world example of orphaned resources (demonstrates value of `BlockDeletionOnFailure` feature)

3. Updated osac-test-infra for upstream phase state renames ([MGMT-22638](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22638))
   - Renamed Ready → Running (9 occurrences across 2 test roles)
   - Successfully validated with E2E testing using AAP Direct provider
   - All 40 test tasks passed with new phase states

4. Merged [PR #12](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-test-infra/pull/12) to osac-test-infra
   - Added E2E test for ComputeInstance deletion during provisioning
   - Enhanced existing tests with job status verification
   - Included phase state updates and provider-aware validation

5. Restructured AAP provisioning documentation
   - Reduced README.md from 1,617 to 351 lines (78% reduction)
   - Split into 4 focused documents: architecture, operations, testing, troubleshooting
   - Committed to feature branch and pushed to fork

6. Implemented repository rename for [MGMT-22671](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22671)
   - Renamed innabox/cloudkit-operator → osac/osac-operator
   - Updated 154 files (Go modules, container registry, Kubernetes resources)
   - All tests and checks passing (formatting, linting, unit tests, integration tests)
   - Created [PR #108](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/108) with migration documentation
