## Accomplishments

- Drafted comprehensive responses to Avishay's review comments on [PR #20](https://github.com/osac-project/docs/pull/20), addressing polling mechanism design, state management approaches, and modular provisioning suggestions
- Completed cleanup of 49 ComputeInstances from vmaas-dev namespace (parallel deletion completed in ~6 minutes)
- Cleaned up 6 orphaned VMs from vmaas-dev-uckczjzmz3f5c namespace (discovered VMs without corresponding ComputeInstances from failed deprovision jobs)
- Updated osac-test-infra codebase to align with upstream [MGMT-22638](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22638) ComputeInstance phase state renames (Ready → Running across 9 occurrences in 2 test roles)
- Validated phase state updates with E2E testing using AAP Direct provider (40 tasks passed, 0 failures, full lifecycle verified)
- Pushed updated code to [PR #12](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-test-infra/pull/12) with test results and phase state update documentation
- Created restructuring plan to reduce AAP provisioning README.md from 1,617 lines to ~340 lines (79% reduction) by splitting operational/testing content into separate documents
