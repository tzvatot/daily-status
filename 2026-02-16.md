# Daily Status - 2026-02-16

## Accomplishments

- Drafted comprehensive responses to Avishay's review comments on [PR #20](https://github.com/osac-project/docs/pull/20) addressing polling mechanism, state management, and modular provisioning design
- Completed cleanup of 49 ComputeInstances from vmaas-dev namespace
- Cleaned up 6 orphaned VMs from vmaas-dev-uckczjzmz3f5c namespace (validated real-world example of orphaned resource problem)
- Updated osac-test-infra to align with upstream ComputeInstance phase state renames (Ready → Running) per [MGMT-22638](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22638)
- Successfully validated E2E test infrastructure with AAP Direct provider (40 tasks passed, 0 failures)
- Merged [PR #12](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-test-infra/pull/12) adding E2E test for ComputeInstance deletion during provisioning
- Restructured AAP provisioning documentation (reduced main README from 1,617 to 351 lines, 78% reduction) by splitting into operations.md, testing.md, and troubleshooting.md for [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031)
- Renamed repository from innabox/cloudkit-operator to osac/osac-operator per [MGMT-22671](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22671) (updated 154 files, all tests and pre-commit hooks passing)
- Created [PR #108](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/108) with repository rename changes including detailed backwards compatibility preservation
