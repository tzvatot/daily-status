# Daily Status - 2026-02-16

## Accomplishments

- Drafted comprehensive responses to Avishay's review comments on [PR #20](https://github.com/osac-project/docs/pull/20) (AAP provisioning documentation)
  - Addressed polling mechanism concerns (WebSocket/webhook alternatives investigation, eventual consistency guarantees)
  - Explained state management architecture (CR status in etcd as source of truth, K8s API callback feasibility)
  - Discussed modular provisioning vision (playbook-level modularity, Ansible role composition)
- Completed environment cleanup: 49 ComputeInstances deleted from vmaas-dev namespace
- Cleaned up 6 orphaned VMs from vmaas-dev-uckczjzmz3f5c (real-world validation of AAP Direct `BlockDeletionOnFailure` feature)
- Updated osac-test-infra to align with upstream ComputeInstance phase state renames ([MGMT-22638](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22638))
  - Updated phase references: Ready → Running (9 occurrences across 2 test roles)
  - Rebased feature branch with 15 commits
- Validated E2E tests with AAP Direct provider (all 40 tasks passed, 0 failures)
- Merged [PR #12](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-test-infra/pull/12) to osac-project/osac-test-infra (E2E test for deletion during provisioning + phase state updates)
- Planned documentation restructuring for AAP provisioning README.md (reduce from 1,617 to ~340 lines by splitting into operations.md, testing.md, troubleshooting.md)
- Implemented repository rename from innabox/cloudkit-operator to osac/osac-operator ([MGMT-22671](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22671))
  - Updated 154 files: Go module paths, container registry, Kubernetes resources, namespace names
  - Regenerated 100+ protobuf files with new package prefix
  - Fixed pre-commit hooks and validated all checks pass (formatting, linter, unit tests, integration tests)
  - Created [PR #108](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/108) with migration documentation and backwards compatibility notes
