# Daily Status - 2026-02-16

## Accomplishments

1. Drafted comprehensive responses to Avishay's review comments on [AAP provisioning documentation PR #20](https://github.com/osac-project/docs/pull/20):
   - Explained polling mechanism advantages for distributed system reliability
   - Analyzed Kubernetes API callback approach vs polling trade-offs
   - Documented playbook modularity as future enhancement
2. Completed environment cleanup: 49 ComputeInstances deleted from vmaas-dev namespace
3. Cleaned up 6 orphaned VMs from vmaas-dev-uckczjzmz3f5c (validates AAP Direct `BlockDeletionOnFailure` feature design)
4. Updated osac-test-infra for upstream phase state renames (Ready → Running) aligned with [MGMT-22638](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22638)
5. Successfully validated E2E tests with AAP Direct provider (40 tasks passed, 0 failures)
6. Merged [PR #12](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-test-infra/pull/12) - E2E test for ComputeInstance deletion during provisioning
7. Restructured AAP provisioning documentation (reduced README.md from 1,617 to 351 lines - 78% reduction) by creating separate operations.md, testing.md, and troubleshooting.md guides
8. Implemented repository rename for [MGMT-22671](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22671): innabox/cloudkit-operator → osac/osac-operator (154 files, all tests passing)
9. Created [PR #108](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/108) with comprehensive migration documentation preserving backwards compatibility

## Risks & Challenges
