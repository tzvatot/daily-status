# Daily Status - 2026-02-16

## Accomplishments

- Drafted comprehensive responses to Avishay's review comments on [PR #20](https://github.com/osac-project/docs/pull/20) covering polling mechanisms, state management, and modular provisioning
- Completed cleanup of 49 ComputeInstances from vmaas-dev namespace (6-minute parallel deletion)
- Cleaned up 6 orphaned VMs from vmaas-dev-uckczjzmz3f5c namespace (leftover from failed deprovision jobs)
- Updated osac-test-infra to align with upstream ComputeInstance phase state renames (Ready → Running, 9 occurrences across 2 roles)
- Validated E2E tests with AAP Direct provider (40 tasks passed, 0 failures, ComputeInstance vm-qhq67, jobs 11420/11425)
- Merged [PR #12](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-test-infra/pull/12) to osac-test-infra (E2E deletion test + phase state updates)
- Implemented repository rename for [MGMT-22671](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22671) (innabox/cloudkit-operator → osac/osac-operator, 154 files updated)
- Created [PR #108](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/108) with all rename changes (module paths, container registry, Kubernetes resources, preserved backwards compatibility)
- Fixed `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to use local golangci-lint (all pre-commit hooks now passing)
- Documented restructuring plan for AAP provisioning README.md (reduce from 1,617 to ~340 lines by splitting into operations.md, testing.md, troubleshooting.md)
