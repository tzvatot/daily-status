# Daily Status - 2026-02-16

## Accomplishments

- Drafted comprehensive responses to Avishay's review comments on [PR #20](https://github.com/osac-project/docs/pull/20) (AAP provisioning documentation)
  - Explained polling mechanism rationale: state-based reconciliation vs ephemeral events, crash recovery guarantees, Kubernetes controller pattern alignment
  - Addressed state management concerns: clarified etcd as source of truth, evaluated K8s API callback approach (feasible but doesn't eliminate reconciliation need)
  - Responded to modular provisioning suggestion: acknowledged playbook-level modularity vision, suggested documenting as future enhancement
- Completed cleanup of 49 ComputeInstances from vmaas-dev namespace (parallel deletion in ~6 minutes)
- Cleaned up 6 orphaned VMs from vmaas-dev-uckczjzmz3f5c namespace (leftover from failed deprovision jobs)
- Validated AAP Direct `BlockDeletionOnFailure` feature design through real-world orphaned resource example

## Risks & Challenges

None
