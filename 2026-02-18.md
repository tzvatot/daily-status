# Daily Status - 2026-02-18

## Accomplishments
- Fixed failing unit tests in `computeinstance_feedback_controller_test.go` - updated 2 test fixtures to use `newTestComputeInstanceSpec()` helper
- Corrected import paths across entire codebase (61 files) - migrated from `github.com/osac/osac-operator` to `github.com/osac-project/osac-operator`
- All validations passing: compilation, formatting (go fmt), linter (golangci-lint with 0 issues), unit tests (42.7% controller coverage), kustomize validation, container build
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster with image `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-ca99608`
- E2E testing partial success on instance `e2e-test-api-fields-10003548`: provision job 16063 succeeded, ComputeInstance reached Running phase, runStrategy mutation tests passed (Halted→Always transitions working), immutability validation tests passed (cores/memoryGiB/image patch rejections working)
- Identified deprovision failure in job 16067 - operator code appears correct (`ensureBackwardCompatibility()` called before TriggerDeprovision), issue likely in AAP playbook
- Addressed PR #111 review feedback from Adrien - removed `syncRunStrategy()` controller logic (59 lines), eliminated direct VirtualMachine patching, cleaned up merge conflict backup files
- Completed template PR #6 in osac-templates repository with runStrategy support and explicit API fields support in `roles/ocp_virt_vm/tasks/create.yaml`
- Template changes validated: yamllint passed, all pre-commit hooks passed (8 checks)

## Risks & Challenges
- [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) blocked by PR #112 merge - cannot complete rebase due to module path mismatch between main branch (`github.com/osac/osac-operator`) and actual repository path (`github.com/osac-project/osac-operator`)
- Deprovision playbook may need updates to handle new parameter structure - need AAP logs to diagnose failure
- E2E test cannot complete until deprovision issue resolved - test instance `e2e-test-api-fields-10003548` stuck in deletion

## Key Effort
Completed full implementation and unit testing of ComputeInstance API enhancement for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103), deployed to vmaas-dev, verified provision/runStrategy mutations/immutability enforcement, addressed PR review feedback by removing direct VM manipulation, and created corresponding template updates - blocked on module path fix PR #112 merge before final rebase.
