# Daily Status - 2026-02-18

## Accomplishments
- Fixed failing unit tests in `computeinstance_feedback_controller_test.go`
  - Updated 2 test fixtures to use `newTestComputeInstanceSpec()` helper
  - Ensures all required fields (cores, image, memoryGiB, bootDisk, runStrategy) are properly set
- Corrected import paths across entire codebase (61 files)
  - Migrated from `github.com/osac/osac-operator` to `github.com/osac-project/osac-operator`
- All validations passing:
  - Compilation
  - Formatting (go fmt)
  - Linter (golangci-lint): 0 issues
  - Unit tests: 42.7% controller coverage
  - Kustomize validation
  - Container build: `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-ca99608`
- Pushed 9 commits to fork (20 total in branch) for [[MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)]
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster with image `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-ca99608`
- E2E Testing - Partial Success for test instance `e2e-test-api-fields-10003548`:
  - Provision Phase: ComputeInstance created with explicit API fields, provision job 16063 succeeded, template parameters generated correctly, reached Running phase
  - RunStrategy Mutation Tests: runStrategy=Halted stopped VM successfully, runStrategy=Always restarted VM successfully
  - Immutability Validation Tests: cores, memoryGiB, and image field patches rejected correctly
  - Deprovision Phase: Job 16067 failed with error "failed" (no detailed logs available - job expired), blocking deletion to prevent orphaned resources

## Risks & Challenges
- Deprovision playbook may need updates to handle new parameter structure
- Unknown why deprovision fails - need AAP logs to diagnose
- E2E test cannot complete until deprovision issue resolved
- Stuck test instance `e2e-test-api-fields-10003548` needs deletion

## Key Effort
Completed full implementation and unit testing of ComputeInstance API enhancement for [[MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)]. Deployed to vmaas-dev and verified provision, runStrategy mutations, and immutability enforcement. Investigating deprovision failure - appears to be AAP playbook issue rather than operator code issue.
