# Daily Status - 2026-02-18

## Accomplishments

- Completed implementation and validation of ComputeInstance API enhancement ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)) - all unit tests passing (43.3% controller coverage), linter clean, compilation and kustomize validation passing
- Fixed failing unit tests in feedback controller by updating test fixtures to use `newTestComputeInstanceSpec()` helper
- Corrected import paths across entire codebase (61 files) from `github.com/osac/osac-operator` to `github.com/osac-project/osac-operator`
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster and ran E2E tests - provision, runStrategy mutations, and immutability enforcement all verified successfully
- Addressed PR review feedback from Adrien: removed `syncRunStrategy()` controller logic (59 lines) so templates handle VirtualMachine state instead of the controller
- Created template PR (osac-templates PR #6) adding runStrategy support and explicit API field support to `roles/ocp_virt_vm/tasks/create.yaml`
- Rebased operator PR #111 on latest main after PR #112 (module rename) was merged - resolved conflicts in 5 test files, fixed all import paths and type aliases
- Force-pushed rebased branch (9 clean commits) with all validations passing

## Risks & Challenges

- **Deprovision job failure**: E2E deprovision phase fails - need AAP job logs to diagnose root cause (likely AAP playbook issue, not operator)
- **E2E testing incomplete**: Full lifecycle test (provision → mutations → deprovision) cannot pass until deprovision issue is resolved
- Stuck test instance `e2e-test-api-fields-10003548` needs to be deleted before rerunning E2E tests
- Operator + template integration (PR #111 + templates PR #6) still needs end-to-end verification

## Key Effort

Completed full implementation, PR review response, template PR, and rebase of ComputeInstance API enhancement ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)); now focused on diagnosing the E2E deprovision failure to unblock final validation.
