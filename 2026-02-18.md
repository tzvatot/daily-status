# Daily Status - 2026-02-18

## Accomplishments

**Code Completion & Validation**
- Fixed failing unit tests in `computeinstance_feedback_controller_test.go` by updating 2 test fixtures to use `newTestComputeInstanceSpec()` helper
- Corrected import paths across 61 files, migrating from `github.com/osac/osac-operator` to `github.com/osac-project/osac-operator`
- All validations passing: compilation, formatting (go fmt), linter (golangci-lint with 0 issues), unit tests (42.7% controller coverage), Kustomize validation, and container build (`quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-ca99608`)

**Deployment**
- Pushed 9 commits to fork (20 total in branch) for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster with successful rollout

**E2E Testing - Partial Success**
- Provision phase succeeded: ComputeInstance created with explicit API fields, provision job 16063 completed, template parameters generated correctly, instance reached Running phase
- RunStrategy mutation tests passed: runStrategy=Halted stopped VM successfully, runStrategy=Always restarted VM successfully
- Immutability validation tests passed: patches to cores, memoryGiB, and image fields all rejected correctly
- Deprovision phase failed: job 16067 failed with no detailed logs available (job expired), blocking deletion to prevent orphaned resources

**Blocker Identified**
- Cannot complete rebase of [PR #111](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/111) due to module path mismatch in main branch (`github.com/osac/osac-operator` vs `github.com/osac-project/osac-operator`)
- Blocked by [PR #112](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/112) which must be merged first to fix module path

## Risks & Challenges

- Deprovision job failure needs AAP logs to diagnose - appears to be AAP playbook issue rather than operator code issue
- E2E test cannot complete until deprovision issue resolved
- [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) [PR #111](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/111) blocked waiting for [PR #112](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/112) merge to fix module path mismatch
- Test instance `e2e-test-api-fields-10003548` stuck and needs deletion

## Key Effort

Completed full implementation and unit testing of ComputeInstance API enhancement ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)). Deployed to vmaas-dev and verified provision, runStrategy mutations, and immutability enforcement. Investigating deprovision failure and blocked on module path fix ([PR #112](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/112)) before completing rebase.
