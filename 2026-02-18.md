# Daily Status - 2026-02-18

## Accomplishments

- Fixed failing unit tests in `computeinstance_feedback_controller_test.go` — updated 2 test fixtures to use `newTestComputeInstanceSpec()` helper with all required fields ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103))
- Corrected import paths across entire codebase (61 files) — migrated from `github.com/osac/osac-operator` to `github.com/osac-project/osac-operator`
- All validations passing: compilation, formatting, linter (0 issues), unit tests (42.7% controller coverage), kustomize validation, and container build
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster (9 new commits pushed, 20 total in branch) with successful rollout
- E2E testing partially completed: provision phase succeeded, runStrategy mutation tests passed (Halted/Always), immutability validation passed (cores, memoryGiB, image fields rejected as expected). Deprovision phase failed — likely AAP playbook issue, not operator code
- Addressed PR review feedback from Adrien: removed `syncRunStrategy()` controller logic (59 lines deleted), removed direct VirtualMachine patching from controller. runStrategy changes now auto-trigger provision jobs and templates handle VM state ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103))
- Created template PR for osac-templates adding runStrategy support and explicit API fields support (cores, memoryGiB, bootDisk, image) with fallback to templateParameters
- Identified module path mismatch blocker: PR #111 cannot be rebased until PR #112 (module path fix from `osac/osac-operator` to `osac-project/osac-operator`) is merged

## Risks & Challenges

- Deprovision job failure blocks full E2E lifecycle validation — AAP job logs needed to diagnose root cause
- PR #111 ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)) is blocked by PR #112 (module path rename) which must be merged first before rebase can proceed
- Deprovision AAP playbook may need updates to handle new parameter structure

## Key Effort

Completed full implementation, deployment, and partial E2E validation of the ComputeInstance API enhancement ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)), including addressing PR review feedback and creating the companion template PR.
