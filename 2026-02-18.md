# Daily Status - 2026-02-18

## Accomplishments

- Fixed failing unit tests in `computeinstance_feedback_controller_test.go` — updated 2 test fixtures to use `newTestComputeInstanceSpec()` helper ensuring all required fields are properly set
- Corrected import paths across entire codebase (61 files) — migrated from `github.com/osac/osac-operator` to `github.com/osac-project/osac-operator`
- All validations passing: compilation, formatting (go fmt), linter (golangci-lint: 0 issues), unit tests (42.7% controller coverage), kustomize validation, and container build
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster (9 new commits pushed, 20 total in branch) with successful rollout
- E2E testing partially completed for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103):
  - Provision phase passed — ComputeInstance created with explicit API fields, provision job succeeded, reached Running phase
  - RunStrategy mutation tests passed — Halted stops VM, Always restarts VM
  - Immutability validation tests passed — cores, memoryGiB, and image fields correctly rejected on patch
  - Deprovision phase failed — job error with no detailed logs available; likely AAP playbook issue, not operator
- Addressed PR review feedback from Adrien: removed `syncRunStrategy()` controller logic (59 lines deleted), removed direct VirtualMachine patching from controller; templates now handle VM state instead
- Created template PR ([osac-templates PR #6](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-templates/pull/6)) adding runStrategy support and explicit API fields support to `roles/ocp_virt_vm/tasks/create.yaml`
- Completed rebase of PR [#111](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/111) on upstream/main after PR #112 (module rename) merged — resolved conflicts in 5 test files, fixed all import paths and type aliases, force-pushed to fork
- All post-rebase validations passing: unit tests (43.3% controller coverage), linter (0 issues), clean diff against main

## Risks & Challenges

- Deprovision playbook may need updates to handle new parameter structure — deprovision job failed during E2E testing and root cause is unknown until AAP logs are captured
- E2E test lifecycle cannot fully complete until deprovision issue is resolved
- Stuck test instance `e2e-test-api-fields-10003548` needs to be deleted before rerunning E2E tests
- Operator + template integration not yet verified end-to-end with the new template PR

## Key Effort

Completed full implementation, unit testing, PR review response, template updates, and rebase of the [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API enhancement; deployed to vmaas-dev with partial E2E success, blocked on deprovision failure requiring AAP log investigation.
