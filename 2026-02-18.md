# Daily Status - 2026-02-18

## Accomplishments

- Fixed failing unit tests in `computeinstance_feedback_controller_test.go` by updating test fixtures with required fields
- Corrected import paths across 61 files from `github.com/osac/osac-operator` to `github.com/osac-project/osac-operator`
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster with image `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-ca99608`
- Verified ComputeInstance provision phase success with explicit API fields (cores, memoryGiB, image, bootDisk, runStrategy)
- Validated runStrategy mutation tests: Halted→stopped VM, Always→restarted VM
- Validated immutability enforcement for cores, memoryGiB, and image fields
- Removed `syncRunStrategy()` controller logic per PR review feedback - templates now handle VirtualMachine state
- Created template PR ([osac-templates#6](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-templates/pull/6)) with runStrategy and explicit API field support
- Updated `roles/ocp_virt_vm/tasks/create.yaml` to read spec fields directly with templateParameters fallback
- All validations passing: compilation, formatting, linter (0 issues), unit tests (43.1% coverage), kustomize, container build
- Pushed 9 commits to [PR #111](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/111) for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)

## Risks & Challenges

- Deprovision job 16067 failed with no detailed logs - blocking E2E test completion
- PR #111 blocked by module path mismatch - waiting for PR #112 (module rename) to merge
- Test instance `e2e-test-api-fields-10003548` stuck in deletion due to deprovision failure
- AAP playbook may need updates to handle new parameter structure

## Key Effort

Completed implementation and unit testing of ComputeInstance API enhancement with backward compatibility layer. Deployed to vmaas-dev and verified provision, runStrategy mutations, and immutability enforcement. Removed direct VM manipulation from controller per review feedback and created corresponding template PR to handle spec fields directly.
