# Daily Status - 2026-02-18

## Accomplishments

- Fixed failing unit tests in `computeinstance_feedback_controller_test.go` ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103))
  - Updated 2 test fixtures to use `newTestComputeInstanceSpec()` helper
  - Ensures all required fields (cores, image, memoryGiB, bootDisk, runStrategy) are properly set
- Corrected import paths across entire codebase (61 files)
  - Migrated from `github.com/osac/osac-operator` to `github.com/osac-project/osac-operator`
- All validations passing: compilation, formatting (go fmt), linter (golangci-lint - 0 issues), unit tests (42.7% controller coverage), kustomize validation, container build
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster with image `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-ca99608`
- E2E testing partial success for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103):
  - ComputeInstance provision phase succeeded (job 16063)
  - Template parameters generated correctly via `ensureBackwardCompatibility()`
  - RunStrategy mutation tests passed (Halted/Always transitions working)
  - Immutability validation tests passed (cores, memoryGiB, image fields correctly rejected)
  - Deprovision phase failed (job 16067) - AAP playbook issue suspected
- Addressed PR review feedback: removed `syncRunStrategy()` controller logic (59 lines) per architectural guidance
  - runStrategy changes now trigger provision jobs via FNV-1a hash detection
  - Templates handle VirtualMachine state, not controller
  - Validation passing: unit tests (43.1% coverage), linter (0 issues), compilation successful
- Pushed 9 commits to fork (20 total in branch)

## Risks & Challenges

- PR #111 ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)) blocked by module path mismatch - cannot complete rebase until PR #112 (module rename to osac-project) merges
- Deprovision job failure needs AAP log investigation to determine root cause
- E2E test instance `e2e-test-api-fields-10003548` stuck due to deprovision failure - blocking deletion to prevent orphaned resources

## Key Effort

Completed full implementation and unit testing of ComputeInstance API enhancement ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)), deployed to vmaas-dev, and verified provision/mutation/immutability enforcement. Addressed PR review feedback by removing direct VM manipulation. Blocked on module path fix (PR #112) for rebase and investigating deprovision AAP playbook failure.
