# Daily Status - 2026-02-18

## Accomplishments
- Fixed failing unit tests in `computeinstance_feedback_controller_test.go` for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)
  - Updated 2 test fixtures to use `newTestComputeInstanceSpec()` helper
  - Ensures all required fields (cores, image, memoryGiB, bootDisk, runStrategy) are properly set
- Corrected import paths across entire codebase (61 files)
  - Migrated from `github.com/osac/osac-operator` to `github.com/osac-project/osac-operator`
- All validations passing: compilation, formatting (go fmt), linter (golangci-lint with 0 issues), unit tests (42.7% controller coverage), kustomize validation, and container build
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster with image `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-ca99608`
- Pushed 9 commits to fork (20 total in branch)
- E2E testing partial success for test instance `e2e-test-api-fields-10003548`:
  - ✅ Provision phase: ComputeInstance created with explicit API fields, provision job 16063 succeeded, template parameters generated correctly, reached Running phase
  - ✅ RunStrategy mutation tests: runStrategy=Halted stopped VM successfully, runStrategy=Always restarted VM successfully
  - ✅ Immutability validation tests: cores, memoryGiB, and image field patches rejected correctly
  - ❌ Deprovision phase: Deprovision job 16067 failed (blocking deletion to prevent orphaned resources)

## Risks & Challenges
- Deprovision job failure blocking E2E test completion - appears to be AAP playbook issue rather than operator code issue (needs AAP log investigation)
- Test instance `e2e-test-api-fields-10003548` stuck in deletion pending state
- Unknown root cause of deprovision failure - need to capture AAP job logs during next test run

## Key Effort
Completed full implementation and unit testing of ComputeInstance API enhancement. Deployed to vmaas-dev and verified provision, runStrategy mutations, and immutability enforcement. Investigating deprovision failure.
