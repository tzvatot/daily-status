# Daily Status - 2026-02-18

## Accomplishments

- Fixed failing unit tests in `computeinstance_feedback_controller_test.go`
  - Updated 2 test fixtures to use `newTestComputeInstanceSpec()` helper
  - Ensures all required fields (cores, image, memoryGiB, bootDisk, runStrategy) are properly set
- Corrected import paths across entire codebase (61 files)
  - Migrated from `github.com/osac/osac-operator` to `github.com/osac-project/osac-operator`
- All validations passing:
  - Compilation, formatting (go fmt), linter (golangci-lint): 0 issues
  - Unit tests: 42.7% controller coverage
  - Kustomize validation
  - Container build: `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-ca99608`
- Pushed 9 commits to fork (20 total in branch) for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster
- E2E testing for ComputeInstance API enhancement (test instance: `e2e-test-api-fields-10003548`):
  - Provision phase: Succeeded with explicit API fields (no templateParameters)
  - RunStrategy mutation tests: Halted/Always transitions working correctly
  - Immutability validation tests: cores, memoryGiB, image field patches rejected as expected
  - Deprovision phase: Failed - job 16067 error "failed" (no detailed logs available - job expired)
- Template parameters generated correctly via `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` during provision
- Operator logs confirm backward compatibility called before deprovision

## Risks & Challenges

- Deprovision job failure blocking E2E test completion - need to capture AAP job logs during next test run to diagnose root cause
- Test instance `e2e-test-api-fields-10003548` stuck in deletion (blocking deletion by design to prevent orphaned resources)
- Issue likely in AAP playbook rather than operator code

## Key Effort

Completed full implementation and unit testing of ComputeInstance API enhancement. Deployed to vmaas-dev and verified provision, runStrategy mutations, and immutability enforcement. Investigating deprovision failure - appears to be AAP playbook issue rather than operator code issue.
