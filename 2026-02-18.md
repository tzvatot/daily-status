# Daily Status - 2026-02-18

## Accomplishments
- Fixed failing unit tests in `computeinstance_feedback_controller_test.go` for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)
  - Updated 2 test fixtures to use `newTestComputeInstanceSpec()` helper
  - Ensures all required fields (cores, image, memoryGiB, bootDisk, runStrategy) are properly set
- Corrected import paths across entire codebase (61 files) from `github.com/osac/osac-operator` to `github.com/osac-project/osac-operator`
- All validations passing: compilation, formatting (go fmt), linter (golangci-lint with 0 issues), unit tests (42.7% controller coverage), kustomize validation, and container build
- Pushed 9 commits to fork (20 total in branch) for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster with image `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-ca99608`
- E2E provision phase succeeded: ComputeInstance created with explicit API fields, provision job 16063 succeeded, template parameters generated correctly, reached Running phase
- RunStrategy mutation tests passed: runStrategy=Halted stopped VM successfully, runStrategy=Always restarted VM successfully
- Immutability validation tests passed: cores, memoryGiB, and image field patches rejected as expected

## Risks & Challenges
- Deprovision job 16067 failed with "failed" error (no detailed logs available - job expired)
- E2E test instance `e2e-test-api-fields-10003548` stuck due to deprovision failure
- Deprovision failure appears to be AAP playbook issue rather than operator code issue - need AAP job logs to diagnose

## Key Effort
Completed full implementation and unit testing of ComputeInstance API enhancement ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)), deployed to vmaas-dev, and verified provision, runStrategy mutations, and immutability enforcement while investigating deprovision failure.
