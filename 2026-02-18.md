# Daily Status - 2026-02-18

## Accomplishments

- Fixed failing unit tests in `computeinstance_feedback_controller_test.go` by updating 2 test fixtures to use `newTestComputeInstanceSpec()` helper
- Corrected import paths across entire codebase (61 files) from `github.com/osac/osac-operator` to `github.com/osac-project/osac-operator`
- All validations passing: compilation, formatting, linter (0 issues), unit tests (42.7% controller coverage), kustomize validation, and container build
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster with image `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-ca99608`
- E2E testing partially successful for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103):
  - ✅ Provision phase: ComputeInstance created with explicit API fields, provision job succeeded, template parameters generated correctly, instance reached Running phase
  - ✅ RunStrategy mutation tests: Halted and Always states working correctly
  - ✅ Immutability validation: cores, memoryGiB, and image field patches properly rejected
  - ❌ Deprovision phase: Job failed (needs AAP log investigation)
- Removed `syncRunStrategy()` controller logic per PR review feedback (commit `32ca27e`)
- Created template PR at https://github.com/osac-project/osac-templates/pull/6 with runStrategy support and explicit API fields support
- Template changes validated: yamllint passed, all pre-commit hooks passed (8 checks)

## Risks & Challenges

- **BLOCKED**: Cannot complete rebase of PR #111 ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)) due to module path mismatch in main branch - waiting for PR #112 merge
- Deprovision job failure in E2E testing - appears to be AAP playbook issue rather than operator code issue, needs AAP log investigation
- E2E test cannot complete until deprovision issue resolved

## Key Effort

Completed full implementation and unit testing of ComputeInstance API enhancement for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103), deployed to vmaas-dev, verified provision/mutation/immutability phases, addressed PR review feedback, and created corresponding template PR - blocked on module path fix merge before final rebase and E2E completion.
