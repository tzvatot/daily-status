# Daily Status - 2026-02-18

## Accomplishments

- Completed code validation and fixed failing unit tests in `computeinstance_feedback_controller_test.go` for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API Enhancement
- Corrected import paths across 61 files (migrated from `github.com/osac/osac-operator` to `github.com/osac-project/osac-operator`)
- All validations passing: compilation, formatting, linter (0 issues), unit tests (43.3% controller coverage), kustomize validation, and container build
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster and verified E2E: provision succeeded, runStrategy mutation tests passed, immutability validation tests passed
- Addressed PR review feedback from Adrien: removed `syncRunStrategy()` controller logic (59 lines deleted) so templates handle VirtualMachine state instead of the controller
- Created template PR (osac-templates PR #6) adding runStrategy support and explicit API field support with fallback to templateParameters
- Rebased PR #111 on latest main after PR #112 (module rename) was merged, resolving conflicts in 5 test files and fixing all import paths
- Force-pushed rebased branch (9 commits) to fork with clean diff against main

## Risks & Challenges

- Deprovision job failure during E2E testing — need AAP logs to diagnose root cause; E2E lifecycle test cannot fully complete until resolved
- PR #111 rebase was blocked by module path mismatch in main branch (resolved after PR #112 merged)
- Deprovision playbook may need updates to handle new parameter structure

## Key Effort

Completed full implementation, unit testing, PR review response, and template PR for the [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API Enhancement, with E2E validation in progress pending deprovision failure investigation.
