# Daily Status - 2026-02-18

## Accomplishments

- Fixed failing unit tests in `computeinstance_feedback_controller_test.go` — updated 2 test fixtures to use `newTestComputeInstanceSpec()` helper ensuring all required fields are properly set ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103))
- Corrected import paths across entire codebase (61 files) — migrated from `github.com/osac/osac-operator` to `github.com/osac-project/osac-operator`
- All validations passing: compilation, formatting, linter (0 issues), unit tests (42.7% → 43.3% controller coverage), kustomize validation, and container build
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster successfully (image: `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-2913446`)
- E2E testing partially complete — provision, runStrategy mutations (Halted/Always), and immutability enforcement (cores, memoryGiB, image) all verified successfully
- Addressed PR review feedback from Adrien on [operator PR #111](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/111): removed `syncRunStrategy()` controller logic (59 lines deleted) so templates handle VirtualMachine state instead of the controller
- Completed rebase of PR #111 on upstream/main after PR #112 (module rename) merged — resolved conflicts in 5 test files, fixed all import paths and type aliases
- Created and iterated on [template PR #6](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-templates/pull/6) in osac-templates — added runStrategy support, explicit API fields support, sshKey, userDataSecretRef, and additionalDisks handling
- Addressed all of Adrien's review feedback on template PR #6: switched to `runStrategy` directly instead of `running` boolean, renamed `vm_disk_size` to `vm_boot_disk_size`, added missing spec fields, and removed spec fields from `argument_specs.yaml` to read directly from `compute_instance.spec.*`

## Risks & Challenges

- Deprovision job failure during E2E testing — root cause unknown, need AAP job logs to diagnose (likely AAP playbook issue, not operator)
- E2E test cannot complete full lifecycle until deprovision issue is resolved
- Stuck test instance `e2e-test-api-fields-10003548` needs manual deletion before retesting
- Operator + template integration not yet verified end-to-end with updated template PR

## Key Effort

Completed full implementation, unit testing, and deployment of the [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API enhancement across both operator and template repos, addressed all PR review feedback, and progressed E2E testing with deprovision failure as the remaining blocker.
