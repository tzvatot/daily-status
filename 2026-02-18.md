# Daily Status - 2026-02-18

## Accomplishments
- Fixed failing unit tests in `computeinstance_feedback_controller_test.go`
  - Updated 2 test fixtures to use `newTestComputeInstanceSpec()` helper
  - Ensures all required fields (cores, image, memoryGiB, bootDisk, runStrategy) are properly set
- Corrected import paths across entire codebase (61 files)
  - Migrated from `github.com/osac/osac-operator` to `github.com/osac-project/osac-operator`
- All validations passing:
  - ✅ Compilation
  - ✅ Formatting (go fmt)
  - ✅ Linter (golangci-lint): 0 issues
  - ✅ Unit tests: 42.7% controller coverage
  - ✅ Kustomize validation
  - ✅ Container build: `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-ca99608`
- Pushed 9 commits to fork (20 total in branch)
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster with image `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-ca99608`
- E2E testing for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) - Partial Success:
  - ✅ Provision phase succeeded (job 16063)
  - ✅ Template parameters generated correctly via `ensureBackwardCompatibility()`
  - ✅ ComputeInstance reached Running phase
  - ✅ runStrategy mutation tests passed (Halted → Always)
  - ✅ Immutability validation tests passed (cores, memoryGiB, image fields rejected)
  - ❌ Deprovision phase failed (job 16067) - needs AAP log investigation

## Risks & Challenges
- Deprovision job failure blocking E2E test completion - appears to be AAP playbook issue rather than operator code
- Need to capture AAP job logs during next test run to diagnose root cause
- Test instance `e2e-test-api-fields-10003548` is stuck pending deprovision cleanup

## Key Effort
Completed full implementation and unit testing of ComputeInstance API enhancement for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103). Deployed to vmaas-dev and verified provision, runStrategy mutations, and immutability enforcement. Investigating deprovision failure.
