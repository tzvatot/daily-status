# Daily Status - 2026-02-18

## Accomplishments
- Fixed failing unit tests in `computeinstance_feedback_controller_test.go`
  - Updated 2 test fixtures to use `newTestComputeInstanceSpec()` helper
  - Ensures all required fields (cores, image, memoryGiB, bootDisk, runStrategy) are properly set
- Corrected import paths across entire codebase (61 files)
  - Migrated from `github.com/osac/osac-operator` to `github.com/osac-project/osac-operator`
- All validations passing:
  - Compilation, formatting (go fmt), linter (golangci-lint): 0 issues
  - Unit tests: 42.7% controller coverage
  - Kustomize validation
  - Container build: `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-ca99608`
- Pushed 9 commits to fork (20 total in branch) for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster
  - Image: `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-ca99608`
  - Rollout completed successfully
- E2E testing partial success on test instance `e2e-test-api-fields-10003548`:
  - Provision phase: Succeeded (ComputeInstance created with explicit API fields, provision job 16063 succeeded, template parameters generated correctly via `ensureBackwardCompatibility()`)
  - ComputeInstance reached Running phase
  - RunStrategy mutation tests: Passed (runStrategy=Halted stopped VM, runStrategy=Always restarted VM)
  - Immutability validation tests: Passed (cores, memoryGiB, image field patches rejected)
  - Deprovision phase: Failed (job 16067 failed with "failed" error, no detailed logs available, blocking deletion to prevent orphaned resources)

## Risks & Challenges
- Deprovision job failure blocking E2E test completion - need AAP logs to diagnose root cause
- Deprovision playbook may need updates to handle new parameter structure
- E2E test cannot complete until deprovision issue resolved

## Key Effort
Completed full implementation and unit testing of ComputeInstance API enhancement. Deployed to vmaas-dev and verified provision, runStrategy mutations, and immutability enforcement. Investigating deprovision failure - appears to be AAP playbook issue rather than operator code issue.
