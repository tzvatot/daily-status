# Daily Status - 2026-02-18

## Accomplishments

- Fixed failing unit tests in `computeinstance_feedback_controller_test.go` — updated 2 test fixtures to use `newTestComputeInstanceSpec()` helper with all required fields
- Corrected import paths across entire codebase (61 files) — migrated from `github.com/osac/osac-operator` to `github.com/osac-project/osac-operator`
- All validations passing: compilation, formatting, linter (0 issues), unit tests (42.7% controller coverage), kustomize validation, and container build
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster (9 new commits pushed, 20 total in branch) with successful rollout
- E2E testing partially completed for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103):
  - Provision phase succeeded — ComputeInstance created with explicit API fields, reached Running phase
  - RunStrategy mutation tests passed — Halted stops VM, Always restarts VM
  - Immutability validation tests passed — cores, memoryGiB, and image fields correctly rejected on patch
  - Deprovision phase failed — job returned "failed" with no detailed logs (job expired); operator code appears correct, issue likely in AAP playbook
- Addressed PR review feedback from Adrien: removed `syncRunStrategy()` controller logic (59 lines deleted), eliminating direct VirtualMachine patching from controller; spec changes now auto-trigger provision jobs handled by templates
- Created template PR ([osac-templates PR #6](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-templates/pull/6)) adding runStrategy support and explicit API fields support to `roles/ocp_virt_vm/tasks/create.yaml`
- Rebased operator PR [#111](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/111) on latest main after PR #112 (module rename) was merged — resolved conflicts in 5 test files, fixed all import paths and type aliases, all tests and linter passing (43.3% coverage)

## Risks & Challenges

- Deprovision playbook failure blocks full E2E lifecycle validation — need AAP job logs to diagnose root cause
- PR #111 rebase was blocked until PR #112 (module path fix) merged — now resolved
- Template PR #6 needs review before operator + template integration can be verified end-to-end

## Key Effort

Completed full implementation, PR review response, template updates, and rebase of the [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API enhancement; E2E testing is in progress with deprovision failure under investigation.
