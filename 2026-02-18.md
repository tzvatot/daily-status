# Daily Status - 2026-02-18

## Accomplishments

- Fixed failing unit tests in `computeinstance_feedback_controller_test.go` by updating 2 test fixtures to use `newTestComputeInstanceSpec()` helper
- Corrected import paths across entire codebase (61 files) from `github.com/osac/osac-operator` to `github.com/osac-project/osac-operator`
- Validated all checks passing: compilation, formatting (go fmt), linter (golangci-lint with 0 issues), unit tests (42.7% controller coverage), kustomize validation, and container build
- Pushed 9 commits to fork (20 total in branch) for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster with image `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-ca99608`
- Successfully tested provision phase: ComputeInstance created with explicit API fields, provision job succeeded, template parameters generated correctly via `ensureBackwardCompatibility()`, instance reached Running phase
- Verified runStrategy mutations: Halted stopped VM successfully, Always restarted VM successfully
- Validated immutability enforcement: cores, memoryGiB, and image field patches all rejected correctly
- Identified blocker: module path mismatch between main branch (`github.com/osac/osac-operator`) and actual repository path (`github.com/osac-project/osac-operator`)

## Risks & Challenges

- Deprovision job 16067 failed with no detailed logs available - needs AAP log investigation to determine root cause
- PR #111 ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)) blocked from rebase completion due to module path mismatch in main branch
- Waiting for PR #112 (module path fix) to be merged before PR #111 can proceed
- E2E testing cannot complete until deprovision issue resolved and test instance deleted

## Key Effort

Completed full implementation and unit testing of ComputeInstance API enhancement, deployed to vmaas-dev, and verified provision/runStrategy/immutability features - blocked on PR #112 merge for module path fix and investigating deprovision failure.
