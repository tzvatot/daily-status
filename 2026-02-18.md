# Daily Status - 2026-02-18

## Accomplishments

- Fixed failing unit tests in `computeinstance_feedback_controller_test.go`
  - Updated 2 test fixtures to use `newTestComputeInstanceSpec()` helper
  - Ensures all required fields (cores, image, memoryGiB, bootDisk, runStrategy) are properly set
- Corrected import paths across entire codebase (61 files)
  - Migrated from `github.com/osac/osac-operator` to `github.com/osac-project/osac-operator`
- All validations passing for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) operator changes:
  - ✅ Compilation, formatting (go fmt), linter (0 issues)
  - ✅ Unit tests: 43.1% controller coverage
  - ✅ Kustomize validation
  - ✅ Container build: `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-ca99608`
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster
  - Pushed 9 commits to fork (20 total in branch)
  - Rollout completed successfully
- E2E testing - partial success for test instance `e2e-test-api-fields-10003548`:
  - ✅ Provision phase succeeded (job 16063)
  - ✅ Template parameters generated correctly via `ensureBackwardCompatibility()`
  - ✅ ComputeInstance reached Running phase
  - ✅ RunStrategy mutation tests (Halted → Always) passed
  - ✅ Immutability validation tests (cores, memoryGiB, image) passed
  - ❌ Deprovision phase failed (job 16067) - needs AAP log investigation
- Addressed PR review feedback from Adrien:
  - Removed `syncRunStrategy()` controller logic (59 lines deleted)
  - Removed direct VirtualMachine patching from controller
  - runStrategy now handled by templates via provision jobs
  - Commit `32ca27e`: "Remove syncRunStrategy() controller logic per PR review"
- Completed template PR for osac-templates:
  - Created PR #6: https://github.com/osac-project/osac-templates/pull/6
  - Branch: `feature/support-runstrategy-mgmt-23103`
  - Added runStrategy support to `roles/ocp_virt_vm/tasks/create.yaml` (commit `d49bb16`)
  - Added explicit API fields support (cores, memoryGiB, bootDisk, image) with templateParameters fallback (commit `da40288`)
  - ✅ yamllint and all pre-commit hooks passed (8 checks)

## Risks & Challenges

- Blocked by PR #112 module path fix - cannot complete rebase of PR #111 until main branch module path is corrected from `github.com/osac/osac-operator` to `github.com/osac-project/osac-operator`
- Deprovision playbook failure (job 16067) - need to capture AAP logs during next test run to diagnose root cause
- E2E testing cannot complete until deprovision issue is resolved

## Key Effort

Completed implementation and unit testing of ComputeInstance API enhancement for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103), addressed PR review feedback by removing direct VM manipulation, and created corresponding template changes in osac-templates PR #6. Blocked on module path fix (PR #112) before rebasing and investigating deprovision failure.
