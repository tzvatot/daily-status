# Daily Status - 2026-02-11

## Accomplishments
- Created comprehensive AAP provisioning documentation (~1,600 lines) covering architecture, configuration, operations, testing, and troubleshooting at `architecture/aap-provisioning/README.md` with all 4 UML diagrams embedded
- Submitted pull request for AAP provisioning documentation: [osac-docs PR #20](https://github.com/osac-project/docs/pull/20) for [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031)
- Implemented all code changes for osac-operator PR #102 review feedback:
  - Made `invalidateTemplateCache` private with centralized 404 handling via `doTemplateRequest()` wrapper
  - Refactored provider factory pattern into `internal/provisioning/factory.go` with `ProviderConfig` struct
  - Standardized terminology: renamed EDA webhook env vars from `CREATE/DELETE` to `PROVISION/DEPROVISION`
  - Removed duplicate provider constants from `cmd/main.go`
- Validated both AAP Direct (jobs 8562, 8563) and EDA provider (eda-webhook) through integration testing on vmaas-dev namespace
- Updated deployment files in cloudkit-operator README.md and created [osac-installer PR #40](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-installer/pull/40) for env var renaming
- Proposed `status.jobs[]` array pattern for job tracking (discussed at https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102#discussion_r2793270994)

## Risks & Challenges
- Awaiting feedback on proposed `status.jobs[]` array structure before finalizing PR #102 comment responses
- Two PRs pending review: osac-docs PR #20 and osac-installer PR #40

## Key Effort
Completed AAP Direct provider PR #102 implementation and comprehensive documentation with integration testing across both AAP Direct and EDA providers
