# Daily Status - 2026-02-11

## Accomplishments
- Created comprehensive AAP provisioning documentation (~1,600 lines) at `architecture/aap-provisioning/README.md` with all 10 sections complete and 4 UML diagrams embedded - [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031)
- Submitted documentation pull request to osac-docs: https://github.com/osac-project/docs/pull/20
- Implemented all code changes for osac-operator PR #102: cache invalidation fix, factory refactoring, and terminology standardization (CREATE/DELETE → PROVISION/DEPROVISION)
- Validated both AAP Direct and EDA providers through integration testing (jobs 8562, 8563)
- Updated deployment files across cloudkit-operator and osac-installer repositories with new environment variable names
- Created osac-installer PR #40: https://github.com/osac-project/osac-installer/pull/40
- Proposed status.jobs[] array pattern for job tracking in PR #102 discussion

## Risks & Challenges
- Awaiting reviewer feedback on status.jobs[] proposal before finalizing PR #102 comment responses
- Awaiting review on osac-docs PR #20 and osac-installer PR #40

Completed AAP Direct provider documentation and PR #102 implementation with comprehensive testing across multiple repositories
