# Daily Status - 2026-02-11

## Accomplishments
- Analyzed [PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) review feedback from adriengentil (9 comments total)
- Created detailed response plan categorizing comments into: defer to separate PR (2), explain architecture (3), and code changes required (4)
- Identified code changes needed: terminology standardization (provision/deprovision), cache method visibility, duplicate constant removal, and factory pattern refactoring
- Planned AAP Direct provisioning documentation for osac-docs (~1800 lines covering architecture, configuration, operations, testing, and troubleshooting)
- Created comprehensive documentation outline with 10 sections and 4 UML diagrams on branch `feature/aap-provisioning-test-docs-MGMT-23031`

## Risks & Challenges
- Cloudkit→osac renaming deferred to separate PR (affects ~100+ files across repos)
- Documentation effort estimated at 6-10 hours across multiple sessions

## Key Effort
Responded to [PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) code review and planned comprehensive AAP Direct provisioning documentation
