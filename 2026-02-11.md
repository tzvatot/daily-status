# Daily Status - 2026-02-11

## Accomplishments
- Created comprehensive AAP provisioning documentation (~1,600 lines) at `architecture/aap-provisioning/README.md` with all 10 sections complete and 4 UML diagrams embedded
- Updated `architecture/README.md` to reference new AAP provisioning documentation
- Committed and pushed documentation changes (11 files, 1,976 insertions) to branch `feature/aap-provisioning-test-docs-MGMT-23031`
- Created pull request for AAP provisioning documentation: https://github.com/osac-project/docs/pull/20 ([MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031))
- Implemented code changes for osac-operator PR #102 review comments:
  - Made `invalidateTemplateCache` private with `doTemplateRequest()` wrapper and comprehensive unit tests (comment #6)
  - Created provider factory pattern in `internal/provisioning/factory.go` with `ProviderConfig` and `NewProvider()` (comment #9)
  - Standardized terminology: renamed env vars from CREATE/DELETE to PROVISION/DEPROVISION (comment #5)
- Built and deployed operator images (`fbebb50`, `7bf0069`) to `vmaas-dev` namespace
- Successfully validated both AAP Direct provider (jobs 8562, 8563) and EDA provider (eda-webhook) integration tests
- Updated deployment documentation in cloudkit-operator `README.md` for env var renaming (commit 143416f)
- Updated osac-installer deployment manifests in `overlays/development/kustomization.yaml` (commit f1e87f8)
- Created fork `tzvatot/osac-installer` and submitted PR #40: https://github.com/osac-project/osac-installer/pull/40
- Verified comprehensive search across all repos - no remaining references to old env var names

## Risks & Challenges
- PR #102 comment responses still being drafted (code complete, awaiting final response posting and re-review)
- Exploring Conditions array pattern for audit trail instead of separate provision/deprovision job fields (architectural discussion ongoing)

## Key Effort
Completed AAP provisioning documentation and implemented all code changes for osac-operator PR #102 review feedback with full integration testing validation
