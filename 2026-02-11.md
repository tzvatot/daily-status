# Daily Status - 2026-02-11

## Accomplishments
- Created comprehensive AAP provisioning documentation (~1,600 lines) at `architecture/aap-provisioning/README.md` with all 10 sections complete (overview, architecture, implementation, configuration, operations, testing, troubleshooting, design decisions, future enhancements, references)
- Submitted documentation pull request for [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) at https://github.com/osac-project/docs/pull/20
- Implemented all code changes for osac-operator PR #102 review comments: made `invalidateTemplateCache` private with `doTemplateRequest()` wrapper, refactored provider factory pattern to `internal/provisioning/factory.go`, standardized terminology from CREATE/DELETE to PROVISION/DEPROVISION
- Integration tested both AAP Direct (jobs 8562, 8563) and EDA providers successfully in vmaas-dev namespace
- Updated deployment files across cloudkit-operator and osac-installer (PR #40) with renamed environment variables
- Proposed status.jobs[] array pattern for job tracking to address PR review discussion (https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102#discussion_r2793270994)

## Risks & Challenges
- Awaiting review on osac-docs PR #20 and osac-operator PR #102
- Status structure proposal (jobs array pattern) pending feedback from @adriengentil before implementation

## Key Effort
Completed AAP provisioning documentation and implemented all PR #102 code review feedback with successful integration testing
