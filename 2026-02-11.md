# Daily Status - 2026-02-11

## Accomplishments
- Created comprehensive AAP provisioning abstraction documentation (~1,600 lines) at `architecture/aap-provisioning/README.md` for [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031)
- Submitted pull request [#20](https://github.com/osac-project/docs/pull/20) to osac-docs with full documentation covering provider architecture, operational guides, testing, and troubleshooting
- Embedded all 4 UML diagrams (component, EDA deletion, AAP Direct creation/deletion sequences) into documentation
- Created detailed response plan for PR [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) review comments covering 9 inline and general comments
- Committed and pushed 11 files (1,976 insertions) to branch `feature/aap-provisioning-test-docs-MGMT-23031`

## Risks & Challenges
- PR #102 has 7 inline code comments requiring implementation changes (terminology consistency, cache visibility, duplicate constants, factory refactoring)
- Comprehensive cloudkit→osac renaming deferred to separate PR (~100+ files affected)

## Key Effort
AAP Direct provider documentation and PR review response planning
