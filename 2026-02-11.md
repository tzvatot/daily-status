# Daily Status - 2026-02-11

## Accomplishments
- Completed comprehensive review of [PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) (AAP Direct provider) and prepared detailed response plan for all 9 reviewer comments
- Designed response strategy: deferring cloudkit→osac renaming to separate PR, planning code changes for terminology consistency, cache visibility, provider constants, and factory pattern improvements
- Created detailed documentation plan for AAP provisioning architecture in osac-docs repository (~1800 lines covering provider abstraction, EDA vs AAP Direct, configuration, operations, testing, and troubleshooting)
- Set up documentation branch `feature/aap-provisioning-test-docs-[MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031)` with existing UML diagrams and images ready for integration
