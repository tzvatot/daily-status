# Daily Status - 2026-02-03

## Accomplishments
- Created integration tests for provisioning controller workflow in [MGMT-23041](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23041)
  - Implemented controllableProvider mock for integration testing
  - Added 5 test scenarios covering provisioning workflow, job state transitions, failure handling, deprovisioning with finalizer removal, and long-running job polling
  - All 58 controller tests passing with 40.9% coverage
- Completed E2E test plan for [MGMT-23042](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23042)
  - Documented 6 test scenarios including EDA/AAP provider testing, job tracking, failure handling, and provider migration
  - Includes verification commands, troubleshooting guide, and success criteria
- Completed documentation and migration guide for [MGMT-23043](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23043)
  - Created comprehensive migration guide covering prerequisites, configuration options, AAP template requirements, and 6-step migration process
  - Documented idempotency requirements and job tracking CRD changes
- Deployed operator with AAP provider configuration
  - Built and pushed container image `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:aap-provisioning-0d788f2`
  - Configured AAP credentials and environment variables
  - Verified AAP provider initialization in operator logs
- Set up AAP infrastructure in vmaas-dev namespace
  - Created personal access token (expires 3025-06-06)
  - Identified templates: `innabox-create-compute-instance` (provision) and `innabox-delete-compute-instance` (deprovision)
  - Verified token authentication via gateway route
- Completed previous work on [MGMT-23040](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23040) - 17 unit tests for provisioning job lifecycle

## Risks & Challenges
- AAP controller must be accessed via gateway route (`/api/controller/` path) instead of internal service URLs for bearer token authentication
- E2E test execution requires AAP/EDA infrastructure access

## Key Effort
Integration testing and E2E test preparation for AAP provisioning abstraction ([MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880))
