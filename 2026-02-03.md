# Daily Status - 2026-02-03

## Accomplishments
- Created `internal/controller/computeinstance_integration_test.go` with controllableProvider mock for integration testing
- Implemented 5 integration test scenarios covering provisioning/deprovisioning workflows, job state transitions, failure handling, and polling behavior
- All 58 controller tests passing with 41.5% coverage
- Committed integration tests: `0d788f2` - "Add integration tests for provisioning controller workflow"
- Completed E2E test plan ([MGMT-23042](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23042)) with 6 test scenarios, verification commands, and troubleshooting guide
- Completed documentation and migration guide ([MGMT-23043](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23043)) covering prerequisites, configuration, migration steps, and rollback procedures
- Successfully built operator and configured AAP infrastructure in vmaas-dev namespace
- Deployed operator with AAP provider to Kubernetes cluster using image `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:aap-provisioning-0d788f2`
- Discovered and fixed template lookup bug where AAP client was incorrectly using template name in URL path instead of query parameter
- Refactored template caching architecture: added `Template` struct, created `GetTemplateByName()` and `GetTemplate()` helper functions, removed redundant `DetectTemplateType()` function
- Template caching now stores complete Template objects with ID, Name, and Type fields for efficient job launching
- All unit tests updated and passing with improved test coverage (AAP client: 86.8%, provisioning package: 80.9%)

## Risks & Challenges
- E2E testing blocked pending operator image rebuild with bug fix and deployment of updated image to verify provision/deprovision workflow with correct job tracking field population

## Key Effort
Completed integration testing for [MGMT-23041](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23041), E2E test planning, documentation, and discovered/fixed critical AAP template lookup bug during operator deployment testing
