# Daily Status - 2026-02-03

## Accomplishments
- [MGMT-23041](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23041): Created integration tests for provisioning controller workflow
  - Implemented controllableProvider mock for integration testing
  - Added 5 test scenarios: provisioning workflow with job state transitions, provision job failure handling, deprovisioning workflow with finalizer removal, deprovisioning allows deletion even when job fails, long-running job polling
  - All 58 controller tests passing, coverage at 41.5%
  - Commit: `0d788f2`
- [MGMT-23040](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23040): Completed unit tests for provisioning job lifecycle (17 test cases, controller coverage increased to 40.9%)
- [MGMT-23042](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23042): Created comprehensive E2E test plan with 6 test scenarios
- [MGMT-23043](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23043): Created migration guide and documentation covering prerequisites, configuration, migration steps, rollback, and troubleshooting
- E2E Testing Preparation: Built operator, set up AAP infrastructure in vmaas-dev namespace, created personal access token, identified AAP templates for ComputeInstance
- Operator Deployment: Deployed operator with AAP provider configuration, verified AAP provider initialization in logs
- Built and pushed container image `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:aap-provisioning-0d788f2`

## Risks & Challenges
- E2E test execution requires AAP/EDA infrastructure access
- AAP controller must be accessed via gateway route (slight overhead but functional)

## Key Effort
Integration testing and E2E preparation for AAP provisioning abstraction with controller workflow verification
