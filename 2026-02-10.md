# Daily Status - 2026-02-10

## Accomplishments
- Completed AAP vs EDA latency comparison experiment showing EDA 12.8% faster overall (232.0s vs 266.0s) due to 35.3% faster deprovisioning despite 4.2% slower provisioning
- Created complete delete-during-provision test infrastructure (`test_delete_during_provision.sh`, `test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml`) with provider detection and validation logic
- Fixed critical bug where controller wasn't updating provision job state in CR status after canceling job via AAP API
- Fixed bug where provision job state wasn't updated when deprovision was triggered (only during waiting phase)
- Fixed bug where provision job message field showed stale "running" value when state changed to "Canceled"
- Successfully validated all fixes end-to-end with both AAP (vm-7wfkv) and EDA (vm-v92sd) providers showing correct state/message updates and proper cleanup

## Risks & Challenges
- Infrastructure issues encountered during testing (intermittent fulfillment API connectivity problems)
- Initial test runs blocked by "no route to host" errors requiring multiple retry attempts

## Key Effort
Fixed controller provision job status updates to correctly reflect both state and message fields in CR status during deletion workflows.
