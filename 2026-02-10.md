# Daily Status - 2026-02-10

## Accomplishments
- Ran parallel latency comparison experiment between AAP Direct and EDA providers (3 runs each) - EDA showed 12.8% better overall performance (232.0s vs 266.0s) due to 35.3% faster deprovisioning, outweighing AAP's 4.2% provisioning advantage
- Created delete-during-provision test infrastructure including `test_delete_during_provision.sh` script and updated `test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml` playbook with provider detection, faster polling intervals, and comprehensive validation logic
- Fixed critical bug where controller wasn't updating CR's `status.provisionJob.state` to "Canceled" after canceling job via AAP API - external observers couldn't see job cancellation (commit 2953ef1)
- Fixed second bug where provision job state wasn't updated when deprovision was triggered (only during waiting phase) - extended fix to update state in both `DeprovisionWaiting` and `DeprovisionTriggered` cases (commit b429e06)
- Fixed third bug where provision job message field remained stale ("running") when state changed to "Canceled" - changed provider interface to return full `ProvisionStatus` struct with both state and message fields (commit fbebb50)
- Fixed test playbook parsing error and variable name collision where AAP and EDA tasks overwrote each other's results (commits 2bcec4c, 4eedadb)
- Successfully validated complete fix end-to-end with test run vm-7wfkv showing correct state updates ("Canceled"), message updates ("canceled"), and full CR deletion with no orphaned resources
- Deployed cloudkit-operator three times through full validation pipeline (make build, test, lint + validate-cloudkit-operator.sh) with final image quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:fbebb50

## Risks & Challenges
Infrastructure issues encountered during testing including intermittent fulfillment API connectivity problems (no route to host) blocking some test runs

## Key Effort
Fixed provision job status visibility in ComputeInstance CRs by ensuring controller updates both state and message fields when canceling provision jobs, enabling external observers to see job cancellation status
