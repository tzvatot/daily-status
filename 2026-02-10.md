# Daily Status - 2026-02-10

## Accomplishments

- Ran AAP vs EDA latency comparison experiment - EDA showed 12.8% better overall performance (232s vs 266s) due to 35.3% faster deprovisioning, despite AAP being 4.2% faster at provisioning
- Created delete during provision test infrastructure: `test_delete_during_provision.sh` script and updated `test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml` playbook with provider detection and faster polling
- Fixed critical bug where controller was not updating CR's `status.provisionJob.state` field after canceling provision job via AAP API - external observers couldn't see job cancellation
- Fixed second bug where provision job state wasn't updated when deprovision was triggered (only during waiting phase)
- Fixed third bug where provision job message field showed stale "running" value when state changed to "Canceled" - refactored controller to return and update full ProvisionStatus (both state and message)
- Validated complete fix with test run vm-7wfkv: provision job correctly canceled, state and message properly updated, deprovision started after cancellation, CR fully deleted with no orphaned resources
- Fixed test playbook variable name collision where skipped task was overwriting successful deprovision job validation results

## Risks & Challenges

Infrastructure issues encountered during testing: intermittent Fulfillment API connectivity problems (no route to host) blocked some test validation attempts

## Key Effort

Fixed controller provision job status update issues and validated delete during provision behavior end-to-end
