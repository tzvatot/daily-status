# Daily Status - 2026-02-10

## Accomplishments
- Completed AAP vs EDA latency experiment comparing provisioning performance across 3 parallel test runs. EDA showed 12.8% better overall performance (232.0s vs 266.0s) despite AAP being 4.2% faster at provisioning (150.7s vs 157.3s), due to EDA's 35.3% faster deprovisioning (74.7s vs 115.3s)
- Created delete-during-provision test infrastructure: `test_delete_during_provision.sh` script and `test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml` playbook with provider-specific validation logic for both AAP and EDA providers
- Fixed critical bug where controller wasn't updating CR's `status.provisionJob.state` to "Canceled" after canceling job via AAP API, making job cancellation invisible to external observers (cloudkit-operator commit 2953ef1)
- Fixed second bug where provision job state wasn't updated when deprovision was triggered immediately, only during waiting phase (cloudkit-operator commit b429e06)
- Fixed third bug where `message` field remained stale showing "running" when state changed to "Canceled" - refactored provider to return full `ProvisionStatus` struct with both state and message (cloudkit-operator commit fbebb50)
- Successfully validated complete fix with test runs vm-qsfkl and vm-7wfkv (AAP) and vm-v92sd (EDA), confirming both state and message fields update correctly during provision job cancellation
- Fixed playbook validation issues: parsing error and variable name collision between AAP/EDA deprovision job validation tasks

## Risks & Challenges
- Intermittent fulfillment API connectivity issues ("no route to host") blocked some test validation attempts
- Infrastructure instability caused one provision job to fail quickly before cancellation could be tested

## Key Effort
Fixed three related bugs ensuring CloudKit operator correctly updates both provision job state and message fields in CR status when canceling jobs, making cancellation visible to external observers.
