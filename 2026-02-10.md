# Daily Status - 2026-02-10

## Accomplishments
- Ran parallel latency comparison experiment between AAP Direct and EDA providers (3 runs each in vmaas-dev namespace)
  - EDA showed 12.8% better overall performance (232.0s vs 266.0s total cycle time)
  - EDA 35.3% faster at deprovisioning (74.7s vs 115.3s)
  - AAP 4.2% faster at provisioning (150.7s vs 157.3s)
- Created delete-during-provision test infrastructure
  - New script: `test_delete_during_provision.sh`
  - Updated playbook: `test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml` with provider detection, faster polling, and early deletion handling
- Fixed critical bug where controller wasn't updating CR's `status.provisionJob.state` to "Canceled" after canceling provision job via AAP API
  - Modified `provider.go`, `aap_provider.go`, and `computeinstance_controller.go`
  - Validated with full test suite and deployed to cluster (image: quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:2953ef1)
- Validated controller fix handles provision job terminal states (Failed, Canceled, Succeeded) correctly
- Updated test logic to be generic for any terminal provision state

## Risks & Challenges
- Intermittent fulfillment API connectivity issues blocking complete delete-during-provision test validation
- Infrastructure instability preventing full test runs with both AAP and EDA providers

## Key Effort
Fixed controller bug where provision job state updates weren't reflected in CR status, validated with delete-during-provision test implementation
