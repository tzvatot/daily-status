# Daily Status - 2026-02-10

## Accomplishments
- Ran latency comparison experiment between AAP Direct and EDA providers with 3 parallel test runs each in vmaas-dev namespace
- Found EDA provider achieves 12.8% better overall performance (232s vs 266s) despite AAP being 4.2% faster at provisioning, due to EDA's 35.3% faster deprovisioning
- Created `~/work/scripts/test_delete_during_provision.sh` script modeled after `create_ci.sh` pattern
- Updated `osac-test-infra/playbooks/test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml` with provider detection and provider-specific validation logic for testing CI deletion during provisioning
- Implemented distinct validation paths for AAP Direct (provision job → "Canceled", deprovision appears after cancellation) vs EDA (provision job → "Unknown", deprovision appears immediately via webhook)

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Performance analysis and delete-during-provision test infrastructure implementation for AAP vs EDA providers
