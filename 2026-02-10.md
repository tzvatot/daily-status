# Daily Status - 2026-02-10

## Accomplishments
- Ran parallel latency comparison experiment between AAP Direct and EDA providers (3 runs each in vmaas-dev namespace)
  - EDA showed 12.8% better overall performance (232.0s vs 266.0s total cycle time)
  - AAP Direct was 4.2% faster at provisioning (150.7s vs 157.3s)
  - EDA was 35.3% faster at deprovisioning (74.7s vs 115.3s)
- Created `test_delete_during_provision.sh` script for testing CI deletion during provisioning
- Updated `test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml` playbook with provider-specific validation logic
  - AAP Direct: Validates provision job cancellation and sequential deprovision job appearance
  - EDA: Validates webhook-based immediate deprovision job appearance with "Unknown" provision state

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Completed latency testing comparison between AAP and EDA providers and implemented delete-during-provision test infrastructure with provider-specific validation logic.
