# Daily Status - 2026-02-10

## Accomplishments
- Ran latency comparison experiment between AAP Direct and EDA providers (3 parallel runs each in vmaas-dev namespace)
  - EDA showed 35.3% faster deprovisioning (74.7s vs 115.3s)
  - AAP showed 4.2% faster provisioning (150.7s vs 157.3s)
  - EDA overall performance 12.8% better end-to-end (232.0s vs 266.0s total cycle time)
- Created test infrastructure for validating CI deletion during provisioning
  - New script: `test_delete_during_provision.sh`
  - Updated playbook with provider detection (AAP vs EDA) and faster polling intervals
  - Added provider-specific validation logic for provision job states and deprovision job handling
- Fixed critical bug where provision job state was not updated in CR status after cancellation
  - Controller was canceling jobs via AAP API but not writing state back to CR
  - Added `ProvisionJobState` field to `DeprovisionResult` struct
  - Modified AAP provider to return current provision state during cancellation wait
  - Updated controller to write provision job state to CR status during wait phase
  - Deployed fix to cluster (image: quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:2953ef1)
- Validated controller fix handles all terminal provision states correctly (Canceled, Failed, Succeeded)
- Improved test task names to be generic and accept any terminal provision state

## Risks & Challenges
- Fulfillment API connectivity issues blocking complete test validation (intermittent "no route to host" errors)
- Infrastructure instability preventing full test runs of delete-during-provision scenario

## Key Effort
Fixed provision job state update bug and validated deletion-during-provision handling for both AAP and EDA providers
