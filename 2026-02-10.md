# Daily Status - 2026-02-10

## Accomplishments

- Ran parallel latency comparison experiment between AAP Direct and EDA providers (3 test runs each in vmaas-dev namespace)
  - AAP provisioning: 6.7s faster (150.7s vs 157.3s) - 4.2% improvement
  - EDA deprovisioning: 40.7s faster (74.7s vs 115.3s) - 35.3% improvement
  - EDA overall: 34.0s faster end-to-end (232.0s vs 266.0s) - 12.8% improvement
- Created delete-during-provision test infrastructure
  - New script: `test_delete_during_provision.sh`
  - Updated playbook: `test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml` with provider detection, faster polling (1s intervals), and CR deletion handling
- Fixed critical bug where provision job state was not being updated in CR status after AAP API cancellation
  - Added `ProvisionJobState` field to `DeprovisionResult` struct
  - Modified AAP provider to return current provision job state when waiting for cancellation
  - Updated controller to write provision state back to `status.provisionJob.state` field
  - Built, tested, and deployed fix to cluster (image: quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:2953ef1)
  - Validation suite passed: `validate-cloudkit-operator.sh`

## Risks & Challenges

None

## Key Effort

Fixed provision job state update bug preventing CR status from reflecting AAP job cancellation, enabling proper observability for delete-during-provision scenarios.
