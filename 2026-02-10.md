# Daily Status - 2026-02-10

## Accomplishments
- Completed AAP vs EDA latency comparison experiment with 3 parallel test runs per provider
- EDA showed 12.8% better overall performance (34s faster end-to-end) despite AAP being 4.2% faster at provisioning, due to EDA's 35.3% faster deprovisioning
- Created `test_delete_during_provision.sh` script for testing CI deletion during provisioning
- Implemented provider-specific validation logic in `test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml` playbook to handle AAP Direct (canceled state) vs EDA (webhook-based, unknown state) deletion behaviors

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Latency testing between AAP and EDA providers and implementing delete-during-provision test infrastructure with provider-specific validation
