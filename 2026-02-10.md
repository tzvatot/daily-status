# Daily Status - 2026-02-10

## Accomplishments
- Completed AAP vs EDA latency comparison experiment showing EDA 12.8% faster overall (34s) due to 35.3% faster deprovisioning (74.7s vs 115.3s), despite AAP being 4.2% faster at provisioning
- Created delete-during-provision test infrastructure with `test_delete_during_provision.sh` script and `test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml` playbook supporting both AAP and EDA providers
- Fixed critical bug where controller wasn't updating CR's `status.provisionJob.state` to "Canceled" after canceling job via AAP API, making cancellation invisible to external observers
- Fixed bug where provision job state only updated during waiting phase, not when deprovision was triggered
- Fixed bug where provision job message field showed stale values when state changed - controller now returns and updates both state and message fields together
- Successfully validated complete fix end-to-end with both AAP provider (vm-7wfkv: provision job correctly canceled, state/message updated, deprovision started) and EDA provider (vm-v92sd: handled EDA's webhook-based cleanup with "Unknown" state)

## Risks & Challenges
- Fulfillment API connectivity issues encountered during testing (intermittent "no route to host" errors)

## Key Effort
Fixed three related bugs ensuring controller properly updates provision job state and message fields in CR status when canceling jobs, making job lifecycle visible to external observers.
