# Daily Status - 2026-02-10

## Accomplishments
- Ran latency comparison experiment between AAP Direct and EDA providers - EDA showed 12.8% better overall performance (34s faster end-to-end) due to 35.3% faster deprovisioning despite AAP having 4.2% faster provisioning
- Created delete-during-provision test infrastructure (`test_delete_during_provision.sh` script and `test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml` playbook) with provider detection and validation logic
- Fixed critical bug where provision job state was not updated in CR status after cancellation - controller was reading correct state from AAP API but not writing it back to CR
- Fixed second bug where provision job state wasn't updated when deprovision was triggered (only during waiting phase)
- Fixed third bug where provision job message field showed stale "running" value when state changed to "Canceled" - refactored to return full ProvisionStatus struct with both state and message
- Validated complete fix through end-to-end test (vm-7wfkv) - all checks passed including correct state updates, message updates, and no orphaned resources
- Fixed test playbook variable name collision that was causing deprovision job validation failures

## Risks & Challenges
- Infrastructure issues blocking further testing: intermittent fulfillment API connectivity problems (no route to host)

## Key Effort
Fixed provision job status visibility by ensuring controller updates both state and message fields in CR status during deletion workflow.
