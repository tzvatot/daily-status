# Daily Status - 2026-02-10

## Accomplishments

- Ran parallel latency comparison experiment between AAP Direct and EDA providers (3 runs each in vmaas-dev namespace)
  - Results: EDA 12.8% faster end-to-end (232s vs 266s) due to 35.3% faster deprovisioning, despite AAP being 4.2% faster at provisioning
- Created delete-during-provision test infrastructure (`test_delete_during_provision.sh` script and `test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml` playbook)
- Fixed critical bug where controller wasn't updating CR's `status.provisionJob.state` after canceling job via AAP API (commit 2953ef1)
- Fixed second bug where provision job state wasn't updated when deprovision was triggered (only during waiting phase) (commit b429e06)
- Fixed third bug where provision job `message` field showed stale "running" value when state changed to "Canceled" (commit fbebb50)
- Successfully validated complete fix with test run vm-qsfkl - controller now correctly updates both state and message fields in CR status
- Deployed three controller iterations to cluster with full validation suite passing (images: 2953ef1, b429e06, fbebb50)

## Risks & Challenges

- Intermittent fulfillment API connectivity issues blocking some test runs (no route to host errors)

## Key Effort

Fixed provision job status visibility in cloudkit-operator CR by ensuring both state and message fields are updated when jobs are canceled or reach terminal states.
