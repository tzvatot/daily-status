# Daily Status - 2026-02-10

## Accomplishments
- Completed AAP vs EDA latency comparison experiment showing EDA 12.8% faster overall (232s vs 266s total cycle time) despite AAP being 4.2% faster at provisioning - EDA's 35.3% faster deprovisioning outweighs AAP's slight provision advantage
- Created delete-during-provision test infrastructure (`test_delete_during_provision.sh` script and `test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml` playbook) with provider-specific validation logic
- Fixed critical bug where provision job state/message fields weren't updated in CR status after cancellation - external observers (tests, monitoring, users) couldn't see job cancellation even though controller had cancelled via AAP API
- Implemented fix in three iterations: first updated state during waiting phase, then during deprovision trigger, finally ensured message field updated alongside state to prevent stale values
- Validated complete fix with successful test runs for both AAP (vm-7wfkv) and EDA (vm-v92sd) providers - all validations passed including proper state/message updates, no duplicate jobs, full CR deletion, and no orphaned VMs
- Deployed three controller versions to cluster (images: 2953ef1, b429e06, fbebb50) with full validation suite passing for each

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Fixed provision job status visibility bug and validated delete-during-provision behavior across both AAP and EDA providers.
