# Daily Status - 2026-02-10

## Accomplishments
- Completed AAP vs EDA latency experiment showing EDA is 12.8% faster overall (34s) despite 4.2% slower provisioning, due to 35.3% faster deprovisioning (74.7s vs 115.3s)
- Created delete-during-provision test infrastructure (`test_delete_during_provision.sh`, `test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml`) with provider-specific validation logic
- Fixed critical bug where provision job state wasn't updated in CR status after AAP job cancellation - external observers couldn't see cancellation
- Fixed second bug where provision job state only updated during waiting phase, not when deprovision was triggered
- Fixed third bug where provision job message field showed stale "running" value when state changed to "Canceled" - refactored to return full ProvisionStatus with both state and message
- Validated complete fix through successful test runs for both AAP (vm-7wfkv) and EDA (vm-v92sd) providers showing correct state/message updates and CR lifecycle
- Deployed three iterations of controller fixes (images: 2953ef1, b429e06, fbebb50) with full validation suite passing

## Risks & Challenges
- Fulfillment API connectivity was intermittent during testing causing some test runs to fail with "no route to host" errors

## Key Effort
Fixed provision job status visibility in ComputeInstance CR by ensuring controller updates both state and message fields after AAP job cancellation, making job status changes observable to external monitoring and tests.
