# Daily Status - 2026-02-10

## Accomplishments
- Ran AAP vs EDA latency experiment (3 parallel runs each): EDA showed 12.8% better overall performance (232s vs 266s) with 35.3% faster deprovisioning offsetting 4.2% slower provisioning
- Created delete-during-provision test infrastructure: `test_delete_during_provision.sh` script and `test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml` playbook with provider-specific validation logic
- Fixed critical bug where controller wasn't updating CR's `status.provisionJob.state` to "Canceled" after canceling job via AAP API - external observers couldn't see cancellation (deployed image 2953ef1)
- Fixed second bug where provision job state wasn't updated when deprovision was triggered (only during waiting phase) - deployed image b429e06
- Fixed third bug where `status.provisionJob.message` field remained stale showing "running" when state was "Canceled" - refactored to return full `ProvisionStatus` struct instead of just state (deployed image fbebb50)
- Validated complete fix end-to-end: test run vm-qsfkl confirmed both state and message fields update correctly during provision cancellation and deprovision
- Fixed playbook parsing error and variable name collision causing deprovision job validation failures (commits 2bcec4c, 4eedadb)
- Validated delete-during-provision test with AAP provider (vm-7wfkv) - all 6 validations passed including provision cancellation, deprovision startup, and no orphaned resources
- Validated delete-during-provision test with EDA provider (vm-v92sd) - all 5 validations passed with EDA-specific behavior (Unknown state, webhook-based cleanup)

## Risks & Challenges
- Intermittent fulfillment API connectivity issues ("no route to host") blocked some test validation attempts during mid-day testing

## Key Effort
Fixed three related bugs in CloudKit operator's provision job status updates to ensure CR status accurately reflects AAP API state during cancellation and deprovisioning workflows.
