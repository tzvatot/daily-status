# Daily Status - 2026-02-10

## Accomplishments
- Ran latency comparison between AAP Direct and EDA providers: EDA 12.8% faster overall (232s vs 266s) due to 35.3% faster deprovisioning, offsetting AAP's 4.2% provisioning advantage
- Created delete-during-provision test infrastructure: `test_delete_during_provision.sh` script and `test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml` playbook with provider-specific validation
- Fixed critical bug where provision job state wasn't updated in CR status after cancellation: controller now correctly updates both `state` and `message` fields for external observability (commits 2953ef1, b429e06, fbebb50)
- Validated complete fix end-to-end with both AAP (vm-7wfkv) and EDA (vm-v92sd) providers: all test validations passed, no orphaned resources

## Risks & Challenges
Intermittent fulfillment API connectivity issues blocked some test runs during validation

## Key Effort
Fixed provision job status visibility bug discovered during delete-during-provision test implementation
