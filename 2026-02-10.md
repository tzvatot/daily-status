# Daily Status - 2026-02-10

## Accomplishments
- Ran parallel latency comparison experiment between AAP Direct and EDA providers - EDA showed 12.8% better overall performance (34s faster end-to-end) primarily due to 35.3% faster deprovisioning despite 4.2% slower provisioning
- Created infrastructure for testing CI deletion during provisioning: script `test_delete_during_provision.sh` and playbook `test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml` with provider detection and validation logic
- Fixed critical bug where controller was not updating CR's `status.provisionJob.state` to "Canceled" after canceling job via AAP API - external observers couldn't see job cancellation (commit 2953ef1)
- Fixed bug where provision job state wasn't updated when deprovision was triggered (DeprovisionTriggered case) - only worked during waiting phase (commit b429e06)
- Fixed bug where provision job message field showed stale "running" when state was "Canceled" - controller now updates both state and message fields (commit fbebb50)
- Validated complete fix with test run vm-qsfkl - provision job correctly shows state "Canceled" and message "canceled" with no concurrent jobs
- Fixed playbook parsing error and variable name collision causing deprovision job validation failures (commits 2bcec4c, 4eedadb)
- Completed full test validation for AAP provider (vm-7wfkv) - all validations passed including provision cancellation, deprovision startup, and CR cleanup
- Completed full test validation for EDA provider (vm-v92sd) - all validations passed with provider-specific behavior (Unknown state, no explicit deprovision job)

## Risks & Challenges
- Infrastructure issues encountered during testing - fulfillment API connectivity problems (no route to host) blocked some test runs

## Key Effort
Fixed three related bugs ensuring controller properly updates provision job status (state and message) in CR during deletion-during-provisioning scenarios and validated with complete end-to-end tests for both AAP and EDA providers.
