# Daily Status - 2026-02-10

## Accomplishments
- Ran parallel latency comparison experiment between AAP Direct and EDA providers with 3 test runs each - EDA showed 12.8% better overall performance (232.0s vs 266.0s) due to 35.3% faster deprovisioning despite slightly slower provisioning
- Created `test_delete_during_provision.sh` script and `test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml` playbook to test CI deletion during provisioning with provider-specific validation logic
- Fixed critical bug where controller was not updating CR's `status.provisionJob.state` to "Canceled" after canceling job via AAP API - added `ProvisionJobState` field to `DeprovisionResult` struct and updated controller to write provision state back to CR status field
- Modified files in cloudkit-operator (`internal/provisioning/provider.go`, `internal/provisioning/aap_provider.go`, `internal/controller/computeinstance_controller.go`) and validated with full test suite (all passed)
- Deployed fixed controller to cluster (image: quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:2953ef1) and validated that provision job state updates work correctly, handling all terminal states (Canceled, Failed, Succeeded) properly

## Risks & Challenges
- Fulfillment API connectivity issues blocking complete test validation (intermittent "no route to host" errors)
- Need infrastructure stability before running complete end-to-end test with provision job cancellation flow

## Key Effort
Fixed critical controller bug preventing provision job state updates in CR status and validated delete-during-provision handling for all terminal states.
