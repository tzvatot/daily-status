# Daily Status - 2026-02-10

## Accomplishments
- Ran parallel latency comparison experiment between AAP Direct and EDA providers (3 runs each) - EDA showed 12.8% better overall performance (34s faster end-to-end) with 35.3% faster deprovisioning, outweighing AAP's 4.2% provisioning advantage
- Created delete-during-provision test infrastructure: `test_delete_during_provision.sh` script and updated `test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml` playbook with provider detection, faster polling intervals, and comprehensive validation logic
- Fixed critical bug where controller wasn't updating CR's `status.provisionJob.state` to "Canceled" after canceling provision job via AAP API - external observers (tests, monitoring) couldn't see job cancellation
- Fixed second bug where provision job state wasn't updated when deprovision was immediately triggered (only during waiting phase)
- Fixed third bug where `message` field showed stale "running" value when `state` changed to "Canceled" - refactored to return full `ProvisionStatus` struct with both fields
- Validated complete fix end-to-end with test run vm-7wfkv - controller correctly updates both state and message fields, provision job cancellation visible to external observers
- Fixed playbook parsing error and variable name collision causing deprovision job validation failures (separate `aap_deprovision_poll` and `eda_deprovision_poll` variables)

## Risks & Challenges
- Infrastructure intermittently blocking testing: fulfillment API connectivity issues (no route to host) encountered during validation runs

## Key Effort
Fixed controller provision job status visibility bug through three iterations, ensuring both state and message fields are correctly updated in CR status when provision jobs are canceled.
