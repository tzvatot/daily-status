# Daily Status - 2026-02-10

## Accomplishments

- Completed latency comparison between AAP Direct and EDA providers showing EDA 12.8% faster overall (232.0s vs 266.0s total cycle time) due to 35.3% faster deprovisioning (74.7s vs 115.3s), despite AAP being 4.2% faster at provisioning
- Created `test_delete_during_provision.sh` script and supporting playbook infrastructure to validate CI deletion behavior during active provisioning
- Fixed critical bug where controller was not updating `status.provisionJob.state` to "Canceled" after canceling job via AAP API - external observers couldn't see job cancellation (modified provider.go, aap_provider.go, computeinstance_controller.go)
- Fixed second bug where provision job state wasn't updated when deprovision was triggered (DeprovisionTriggered case), only during waiting phase
- Fixed third bug where `status.provisionJob.message` field remained stale showing "running" when state was "Canceled" - refactored to return full ProvisionStatus struct with both state and message fields
- Deployed and validated all fixes: built, tested, linted, and deployed controller images (2953ef1, b429e06, fbebb50) to vmaas-dev cluster

## Risks & Challenges

- Infrastructure issues blocking comprehensive testing: intermittent Fulfillment API connectivity problems (no route to host)
- Some test runs showed provision jobs failing quickly before cancellation could occur, though controller handled these terminal states correctly

## Key Effort

Fixed three related bugs in cloudkit-operator ensuring provision job status (state and message) is accurately reflected in CR status during cancellation and deprovision triggering scenarios.
