# Daily Status - 2026-02-10

## Accomplishments
- Ran parallel latency comparison experiment between AAP Direct and EDA providers (3 runs each)
  - AAP 6.7s faster provisioning (150.7s vs 157.3s, 4.2% improvement)
  - EDA 40.7s faster deprovisioning (74.7s vs 115.3s, 35.3% improvement)
  - EDA 34.0s faster end-to-end (232.0s vs 266.0s, 12.8% overall improvement)
- Created `test_delete_during_provision.sh` script for testing CI deletion during provisioning
- Updated `test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml` playbook with provider-specific validation logic
  - AAP Direct: validates provision job cancellation and sequential deprovision job startup
  - EDA: validates immediate webhook-based deprovision job startup with "Unknown" provision state

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Performance testing and provider behavior validation for AAP Direct vs EDA workflows
