# Daily Status - 2026-02-19

## Accomplishments

- **[MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API Enhancement:**
  - Fixed `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` to support missing fields — added `additionalDisks` and `userDataSecretRef` mappings to templateParameters, changed function to return error instead of silently swallowing
  - Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster (`quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-c960a0f`)
  - Addressed Template PR #6 review comments:
    - Cleaned up `default_arg_specs`, removed spec fields, kept only `exposed_ports`
    - Replaced `cloud_init_config` with `userDataSecretRef` (secret copy between namespaces, conditional cloud-init disk)
    - Fixed `delete.yaml`: `running: false` → `runStrategy: Halted`
    - Added cleanup in delete.yaml for additional disk DataVolumes, user-data secret, legacy cloud-init secret
    - Added `default_spec` in defaults/main.yaml for ComputeInstance spec field defaults
    - Wired up `default_spec` fallbacks in create.yaml spec extraction
    - Updated README to separate template parameters from spec fields documentation
    - Pushed to fork: `etabak-fork/feature/support-runstrategy-mgmt-23103`

## Risks & Challenges

- E2E API fields test still in progress — validates runStrategy mutability and field immutability
- Template PR awaiting re-review; operator still requires `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` until template PR is merged
- Operator-side `default_spec` support not yet started — needed to make defaults discoverable via API and remove Ansible-level fallbacks

## Key Effort

Continued work on the [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API enhancement, focusing on backward compatibility fixes, template PR review feedback, and operator deployment for E2E testing.
