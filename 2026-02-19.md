# Daily Status - 2026-02-19

## Accomplishments
- Fixed `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` to support missing fields — added `additionalDisks` and `userDataSecretRef` mappings to templateParameters, changed function to return error instead of silently swallowing ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103))
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster (`quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-c960a0f`)
- Addressed Template PR #6 review comments ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)):
  - Cleaned up `default_arg_specs`: removed spec fields, kept only `exposed_ports`
  - Replaced `cloud_init_config` with `userDataSecretRef` (secret copy instead of creation, conditional cloud-init disk)
  - Fixed `delete.yaml`: `running: false` → `runStrategy: Halted`
  - Added cleanup in delete.yaml for additional disk DataVolumes, user-data secret, and legacy cloud-init secret
  - Added `default_spec` in defaults/main.yaml and wired up fallbacks in create.yaml
  - Fixed `userDataSecretRef` access with proper default chaining
  - Updated README separating template parameters from spec fields
- Pushed template changes to fork (`etabak-fork/feature/support-runstrategy-mgmt-23103`), awaiting re-review

## Risks & Challenges
- Template PR must be merged before operator can drop `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` translation layer
- E2E API fields test still in progress — validating runStrategy mutability and field immutability

## Key Effort
Continued [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API enhancement — fixing backward compatibility, addressing template PR review comments, and preparing E2E validation.
