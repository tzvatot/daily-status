# Daily Status - 2026-02-19

## Accomplishments
- [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API Enhancement:
  - Fixed `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` to support missing fields — added `additionalDisks` and `userDataSecretRef` mappings, changed function to return errors instead of silently swallowing
  - Deployed updated operator to vmaas-dev cluster (`quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-c960a0f`)
  - Addressed Template PR #6 review comments:
    - Cleaned up `default_arg_specs`, removed spec fields, kept only `exposed_ports`
    - Replaced `cloud_init_config` with `userDataSecretRef` (secret copy from CI namespace to VM namespace, conditional cloud-init disk)
    - Fixed `delete.yaml`: `running: false` → `runStrategy: Halted`
    - Added cleanup in delete.yaml for additional disk DataVolumes, user-data secret, and legacy cloud-init secret
    - Added `default_spec` in defaults/main.yaml for ComputeInstance spec field defaults
    - Updated README separating template parameters from spec fields documentation
    - Pushed to fork for re-review

## Risks & Challenges
- Template PR awaiting re-review — operator still needs `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` to translate spec fields to templateParameters until template PR is merged
- E2E API fields test still in progress (runStrategy mutability, field immutability)

## Key Effort
Continued work on the ComputeInstance API enhancement, focusing on backward compatibility fixes, addressing template PR review comments, and preparing E2E validation.
