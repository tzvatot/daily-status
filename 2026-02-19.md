# Daily Status - 2026-02-19

## Accomplishments
- Fixed `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` to support missing fields (`additionalDisks`, `userDataSecretRef` mappings) and return errors instead of silently swallowing them ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103))
- Deployed updated operator to vmaas-dev cluster (`quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-c960a0f`)
- Addressed and merged Template PR #6: cleaned up `default_arg_specs`, replaced `cloud_init_config` with `userDataSecretRef`, fixed `runStrategy`, added `default_spec`
- Deployed new `osac.openshift.io` CRDs to cluster, created RBAC, renamed `CLOUDKIT_*` → `OSAC_*` env vars, fixed AAP job templates, and removed stuck tenant finalizer
- Fixed storage class bug in template where `lookup('env', ...)` returns empty string instead of undefined, causing `default()` to not trigger (PR #7)
- Updated E2E test for `osac.openshift.io` rename (API version and kubectl commands)

## Risks & Challenges
- Storage class fix (PR #7) needs to be merged and synced to AAP before E2E test can pass
- Dual CRD collision: both `cloudkit.openshift.io` and `osac.openshift.io` CRDs exist on cluster, requiring explicit API group in kubectl commands

## Key Effort
Continued work on [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API enhancement, focusing on fixing compatibility issues from the `osac.openshift.io` rename and resolving a storage class bug to unblock E2E testing.
