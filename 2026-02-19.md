# Daily Status - 2026-02-19

## Accomplishments
- Fixed `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` to support missing fields (`additionalDisks`, `userDataSecretRef` mappings), changed function to return error instead of silently swallowing (commit `c960a0f`)
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster (`quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-c960a0f`)
- Addressed Template PR #6 review comments:
  - Cleaned up `default_arg_specs`, removed spec fields, kept only `exposed_ports`
  - Replaced `cloud_init_config` with `userDataSecretRef` (secret copy, conditional cloud-init disk)
  - Fixed `delete.yaml`: `running: false` → `runStrategy: Halted`
  - Added cleanup in delete.yaml for additional disk DataVolumes, user-data secret, legacy cloud-init secret
  - Added `default_spec` in defaults/main.yaml for ComputeInstance spec field defaults
  - Wired up `default_spec` fallbacks in create.yaml spec extraction
  - Updated README (commit `3e03128`, pushed to fork)
- E2E API fields test prepared and in progress (tests runStrategy mutability, field immutability, cleanup)

## Risks & Challenges
- Template PR awaiting re-review; operator still needs `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` to translate spec fields to templateParameters until template PR is merged
- Operator-side `default_spec` support still pending (operator should read defaults from template's osac.yaml and merge missing spec fields)

## Key Effort
Continued [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API enhancement — fixing backward compatibility, addressing template PR review comments, and preparing E2E validation.
