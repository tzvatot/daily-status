# Daily Status - 2026-02-19

## Accomplishments
- [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API Enhancement: Fixed `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` to support missing fields — added `additionalDisks` and `userDataSecretRef` mappings, changed function to return error instead of silently swallowing
- Built, pushed, and deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster
- Started E2E API fields testing — runStrategy mutability, field immutability, and cleanup scenarios

## Risks & Challenges
- Template PR ([osac-templates#6](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-templates/pull/6)) is pending review and not yet merged/deployed — operator still relies on `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` to translate spec fields to templateParameters for existing templates on the cluster

## Key Effort
Continued work on the ComputeInstance API enhancement, focusing on backward compatibility fixes and E2E validation on vmaas-dev.
