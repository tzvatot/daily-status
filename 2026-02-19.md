# Daily Status - 2026-02-19

## Accomplishments
- Fixed `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` to support missing fields (`additionalDisks`, `userDataSecretRef` mappings) and return errors instead of silently swallowing them
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster (`quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-c960a0f`)
- Addressed and merged Template PR #6 review comments (cleaned up `default_arg_specs`, fixed `runStrategy`, added `default_spec`)
- Deployed new `osac.openshift.io` CRDs and fixed cluster after rename from `cloudkit` — created RBAC, renamed env vars (`CLOUDKIT_*` → `OSAC_*`), fixed AAP job templates, and removed stuck tenant finalizer
- Fixed storage class bug in template where `lookup('env', ...)` returns empty string instead of undefined, causing `default()` to not trigger (PR [osac-templates#7](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-templates/pull/7))
- Updated E2E test for `osac.openshift.io` rename — updated API version and all kubectl commands to use full API group name
- All work under [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103)

## Risks & Challenges
- Storage class fix (PR [osac-templates#7](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-templates/pull/7)) needs to be merged and synced to AAP before the E2E test can pass
- Dual CRD collision: both `cloudkit.openshift.io` and `osac.openshift.io` CRDs exist on the cluster, requiring explicit API group in kubectl commands

## Key Effort
Continued ComputeInstance API enhancement work, focusing on fixing compatibility issues from the `cloudkit` → `osac` rename, resolving a storage class bug, and preparing E2E tests for validation.
