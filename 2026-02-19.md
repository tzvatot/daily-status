# Daily Status - 2026-02-19

## Accomplishments
- Fixed `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` to support missing fields — added `additionalDisks` and `userDataSecretRef` mappings, changed function to return errors instead of silently swallowing them
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster (`quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-c960a0f`)
- Addressed and merged Template PR #6 — cleaned up `default_arg_specs`, replaced `cloud_init_config` with `userDataSecretRef`, fixed `runStrategy`, added `default_spec`
- Deployed new `osac.openshift.io` CRDs to cluster, created RBAC, renamed `CLOUDKIT_*` → `OSAC_*` env vars, fixed AAP job templates, and removed stuck tenant finalizer
- Fixed storage class bug in template — `lookup('env', ...)` returns empty string not undefined, so `default()` never triggered; fixed with `default(storage_class, true)` and added support for `spec.bootDisk.storageClass` (PR #7 merged)
- Updated E2E test for `osac.openshift.io` rename — updated API version and all kubectl commands to use full API group name
- Resolved multiple blockers for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) E2E test: CRDs, RBAC, env vars, AAP playbook names, stuck tenant, kubectl commands, and re-vendored templates

## Risks & Challenges
- E2E test blocked on osac-aap PR #204 merge — needed to trigger EE image rebuild before test can run
- Dual CRD collision (`cloudkit.openshift.io` and `osac.openshift.io`) requires explicit API group in kubectl commands

## Key Effort
Continued [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API enhancement — fixing backward compatibility, resolving `osac.openshift.io` rename fallout across operator/templates/tests, and unblocking E2E validation.
