# Daily Status - 2026-02-19

## Accomplishments
- Fixed `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` to support missing fields — added `additionalDisks` and `userDataSecretRef` mappings to templateParameters, changed function to return error instead of silently swallowing (commit `c960a0f`) ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103))
- Pushed operator to fork and deployed to vmaas-dev cluster (`quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-c960a0f`)
- Started E2E API fields test — testing runStrategy mutability, field immutability, and cleanup via `test_compute_instance_api_fields.yml` playbook

## Risks & Challenges
- Template PR (osac-templates#6) is pending review and not yet merged/deployed — operator relies on `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` to translate spec fields to templateParameters until it lands

## Key Effort
Continued work on the [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API enhancement, focusing on backward compatibility fixes, operator deployment, and E2E validation.
