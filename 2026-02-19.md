# Daily Status - 2026-02-19

## Accomplishments
- Fixed `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` to support missing fields — added `additionalDisks` and `userDataSecretRef` mappings, changed function to return error instead of silently swallowing ([MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103))
- Deployed updated operator to vmaas-dev cluster (`quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-c960a0f`)
- Addressed Template PR #6 review comments:
  - Cleaned up `default_arg_specs`, removing spec fields and keeping only `exposed_ports`
  - Replaced `cloud_init_config` with `userDataSecretRef` (secret copying, conditional cloud-init disk)
  - Fixed `delete.yaml`: `running: false` → `runStrategy: Halted`
  - Added cleanup in delete.yaml for additional disk DataVolumes, user-data secret, and legacy cloud-init secret
  - Added `default_spec` in defaults/main.yaml and wired up fallbacks in create.yaml
  - Fixed `userDataSecretRef` access pattern
  - Updated README to separate template parameters from spec fields documentation
  - Pushed to fork: `etabak-fork/feature/support-runstrategy-mgmt-23103`

## Risks & Challenges
- Template PR awaiting re-review — until merged, operator requires `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` to translate spec fields to templateParameters for existing templates on the cluster
- E2E API fields test still in progress (runStrategy mutability, field immutability validation)

## Key Effort
Continued [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API enhancement work, focusing on backward compatibility fixes, template PR review comments, and E2E test preparation.
