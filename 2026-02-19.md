# Daily Status - 2026-02-19

## Accomplishments

- **[MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API Enhancement:**
  - Fixed `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` to support missing fields — added `additionalDisks` and `userDataSecretRef` mappings, changed function to return errors instead of silently swallowing them
  - Deployed updated operator to vmaas-dev cluster (`quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-c960a0f`)
  - Addressed Template PR #6 review comments:
    - Cleaned up `default_arg_specs`, removing spec fields and keeping only `exposed_ports`
    - Replaced `cloud_init_config` with `userDataSecretRef` (secret copy from CI namespace to VM namespace, conditional cloud-init disk)
    - Fixed `delete.yaml`: `running: false` → `runStrategy: Halted`
    - Added cleanup in delete.yaml for additional disk DataVolumes, user-data secret, and legacy cloud-init secret
    - Added `default_spec` in defaults/main.yaml and wired up fallbacks in create.yaml
    - Fixed `userDataSecretRef` access with proper default handling
    - Updated README with separated template parameters and spec fields documentation
  - Pushed Template PR changes to fork (`etabak-fork/feature/support-runstrategy-mgmt-23103`), awaiting re-review
  - Prepared E2E API fields test playbook covering runStrategy mutability and field immutability

## Risks & Challenges

- Template PR awaiting re-review — until merged, operator requires `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` to translate spec fields to templateParameters for existing templates on the cluster
- Operator-side `default_spec` support still pending (operator should read and merge defaults from template's osac.yaml)

## Key Effort

Continued work on the ComputeInstance API enhancement for [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103), focusing on backward compatibility fixes, template PR review feedback, and E2E test preparation.
