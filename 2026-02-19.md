# Daily Status - 2026-02-19

## Accomplishments
- [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API Enhancement: Fixed `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` to support missing fields — added `additionalDisks` and `userDataSecretRef` mapping to templateParameters, changed function to return error instead of silently swallowing
- Built, pushed, and deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster (`quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-c960a0f`)
- Prepared E2E API fields test covering runStrategy mutability, field immutability, and cleanup

## Risks & Challenges
- Template PR ([osac-templates#6](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-templates/pull/6)) pending review — until merged, operator relies on `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` to translate spec fields to templateParameters for existing templates on the cluster

## Key Effort
Continued work on [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API enhancement, focusing on backward compatibility fixes, operator deployment, and E2E test preparation.
