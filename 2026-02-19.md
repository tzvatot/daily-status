# Daily Status - 2026-02-19

## Accomplishments

- [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API Enhancement - continued implementation
- Fixed `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` to support missing fields (`additionalDisks` and `userDataSecretRef` mapping to templateParameters)
- Built and deployed updated operator to vmaas-dev cluster (`quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-2913446`)
- E2E tested provisioning a ComputeInstance with explicit API fields — verified provision job succeeds and VM runs with correct spec values
- E2E tested deprovisioning a ComputeInstance — verified deprovision job succeeds and resources are cleaned up

## Risks & Challenges

- Template PR ([osac-templates#6](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-templates/pull/6)) is pending review and not yet merged/deployed — operator requires `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` workaround until it lands

## Key Effort

Continued work on the ComputeInstance API enhancement, focusing on backward compatibility fixes and end-to-end validation of provision/deprovision flows on vmaas-dev.
