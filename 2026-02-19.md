# Daily Status - 2026-02-19

## Accomplishments
- Fixed `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` to support missing fields (`additionalDisks`, `userDataSecretRef` mappings) and return errors instead of silently swallowing them
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster (`quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-c960a0f`)
- Addressed and merged Template PR #6 review comments (cleaned up `default_arg_specs`, fixed `runStrategy`, added `default_spec`)
- Deployed new `osac.openshift.io` CRDs and fixed cluster after rename from `cloudkit` — created RBAC, renamed env vars (`CLOUDKIT_*` → `OSAC_*`), fixed AAP job templates, and removed stuck tenant finalizer
- Fixed storage class bug in template where `lookup('env', ...)` returns empty string instead of undefined, causing `default()` filter to not trigger (PR #7)
- Updated E2E test for `osac.openshift.io` rename — updated API version and kubectl commands in osac-test-infra
- Resolved multiple blockers for E2E test: CRDs applied, RBAC created, env vars renamed, AAP playbooks updated, tenant unstuck, kubectl commands fixed

All work under [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103).

## Risks & Challenges
- Storage class fix (Template PR #7) needs to be merged and synced to AAP before E2E test can pass
- Dual CRD collision: both `cloudkit.openshift.io` and `osac.openshift.io` CRDs exist on cluster, requiring explicit API group in kubectl commands

## Key Effort
Continued ComputeInstance API enhancement work, focusing on fixing backward compatibility, completing the `osac.openshift.io` rename across operator/templates/tests/cluster, and debugging a storage class bug exposed during E2E testing.
