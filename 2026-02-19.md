# Daily Status - 2026-02-19

## Accomplishments
- [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API Enhancement:
  - Fixed `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` to support missing fields — added `additionalDisks` and `userDataSecretRef` mappings, changed function to return errors instead of silently swallowing
  - Deployed updated operator to vmaas-dev cluster (`quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-c960a0f`)
  - Addressed Template PR #6 review comments:
    - Cleaned up `default_arg_specs`, removing spec fields and keeping only `exposed_ports`
    - Replaced `cloud_init_config` with `userDataSecretRef` (secret copy, conditional cloud-init disk)
    - Fixed `delete.yaml`: `running: false` → `runStrategy: Halted`
    - Added cleanup in delete.yaml for additional disk DataVolumes, user-data secret, and legacy cloud-init secret
    - Added `default_spec` in defaults/main.yaml and wired up fallbacks in create.yaml
    - Fixed `userDataSecretRef` access pattern
    - Updated README with separated template parameters and spec fields documentation
    - Pushed to fork (`etabak-fork/feature/support-runstrategy-mgmt-23103`)

## Risks & Challenges
- E2E API fields test still in progress — not yet validated end-to-end
- Template PR awaiting re-review; operator still requires `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` shim until template PR merges
- Operator-side `default_spec` support not yet started (next step)

## Key Effort
Continued work on the ComputeInstance API enhancement, focusing on backward compatibility fixes, template PR review feedback, and preparing for E2E validation.
