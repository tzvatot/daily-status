# Daily Status - 2026-02-19

## Accomplishments

- [MGMT-23103](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23103) ComputeInstance API Enhancement - continued implementation
- Fixed `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` to support missing fields (`additionalDisks` and `userDataSecretRef` mapping to templateParameters)
- Built and deployed updated operator to vmaas-dev cluster (`quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:mgmt-23103-2913446`)
- Ran E2E tests: provisioned ComputeInstance with explicit API fields and verified provision job success
- Ran E2E tests: deprovision ComputeInstance, verified cleanup of VM and related resources

## Risks & Challenges

- Template PR (osac-templates#6) is pending review and not yet merged/deployed; operator requires `ensureBackwardCompatibility()` workaround to translate spec fields to templateParameters until it lands

## Key Effort

Continued work on the ComputeInstance API enhancement, focusing on backward compatibility fixes and end-to-end validation of provisioning and deprovisioning flows on vmaas-dev.
