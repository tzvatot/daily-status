# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Completed status.jobs[] array refactoring implementation with 9 commits ([MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031))
- Implemented jobs array API changes: JobType/JobState enums, refactored JobStatus struct, replaced ProvisionJob/DeprovisionJob fields
- Added configurable max job history via CLOUDKIT_MAX_JOB_HISTORY env var (default: 10)
- Implemented controller helpers: FindLatestJobByType(), appendJob(), updateJob() with comprehensive unit tests
- Refactored both AAP and EDA providers to use jobs array pattern
- Consolidated JobState types to single source of truth in v1alpha1 package
- Implemented EDA job ID generation (eda-webhook-N pattern) with comprehensive edge case testing
- Fixed critical provider switch bugs: AAP handling of EDA job IDs and Deleting phase with no deprovision job
- Successfully tested end-to-end with both providers: EDA (eda-webhook-1, eda-webhook-2) and AAP (job IDs: 9076, 9079)
- Validated provider switch scenario: EDA provision → AAP deprovision (jobs: eda-webhook-1 + 9219) - PASSED
- Completed performance testing: 6 parallel VMs (3 AAP, 3 EDA) - AAP 8.4% faster overall, zero performance regression from jobs array
- Tested delete-during-provision scenario: validated job cancellation, no duplicates, proper cleanup
- Updated osac-test-infra to use jobs array with jq-based queries (commit a4c0262)
- Fixed shellcheck errors in osac-test-infra: added set -o pipefail to shell commands (commits d78c030, 4fe6989)
- Updated AAP provisioning documentation for jobs array migration in osac-docs [PR #20](https://github.com/osac-project/docs/pull/20) (commit 778d3e9)
- Updated [PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) description with comprehensive jobs array implementation details
- Built and deployed operator image quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:beec750 to vmaas-dev cluster
- All 69 unit tests passing, linter clean, coverage increased to 66.1% for provisioning package

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Implementing and validating status.jobs[] array pattern for provider-agnostic job tracking across AAP and EDA providers with comprehensive testing including provider switch scenarios
