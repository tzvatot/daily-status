# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Implemented status.jobs[] array refactoring based on [PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) review feedback
- Completed 9 commits implementing jobs array pattern (API changes, infrastructure, controller helpers, provider updates, linter fixes, and provider switch fixes)
- Added JobType and JobState enums, refactored JobStatus struct with jobID, type, timestamp, and state fields
- Implemented configurable max job history with CLOUDKIT_MAX_JOB_HISTORY env var (default: 10)
- Added helper functions: FindLatestJobByType(), findJobByID(), appendJob(), updateJob()
- Implemented EDA job ID generation (eda-webhook-N pattern) with comprehensive tests
- Consolidated JobState type to single source of truth in v1alpha1 package
- Organized job types in dedicated api/v1alpha1/job_types.go file
- Achieved 69 passing unit tests with coverage increase from 63.8% to 66.1%
- Successfully deployed and tested on vmaas-dev cluster with both AAP Direct and EDA providers
- Conducted performance testing: 6 parallel VMs (3 per provider), AAP 8.4% faster overall with no jobs array regression
- Tested complex delete-during-provision scenario with job cancellation validation
- Successfully validated provider switch scenario: EDA provision (eda-webhook-1) → AAP deprovision (job 9219)
- Fixed critical bugs enabling provider switching: handle EDA job IDs in AAP provider (commit 1d5dab3) and handle Deleting phase (commit beec750)
- Updated osac-test-infra to use jobs array with jq-based filtering (commit a4c0262)
- Fixed shellcheck errors in osac-test-infra playbook with pipefail fixes (commit d78c030)
- Updated [PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) description with comprehensive implementation details
- Created MEMORY.md documentation for CRD regeneration workflow and daily status management

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Implementing and validating status.jobs[] array refactoring with provider-agnostic job tracking across AAP and EDA providers.
