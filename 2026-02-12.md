# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Completed status.jobs[] array refactoring implementation ([MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031))
- Implemented 6 commits across API, infrastructure, controller helpers, and provider updates
- Added JobType enum (provision, deprovision) and JobState enum (Pending, Waiting, Running, Succeeded, Failed, Canceled, Unknown)
- Refactored JobStatus struct with required fields (JobID, Type, Timestamp, State)
- Replaced ProvisionJob/DeprovisionJob fields with Jobs[] array in ComputeInstanceStatus
- Added configurable max job history via CLOUDKIT_MAX_JOB_HISTORY env var (default: 10)
- Implemented helper functions: FindLatestJobByType(), findJobByID(), appendJob(), updateJob()
- Consolidated JobState type (single source of truth in v1alpha1)
- Organized job types into dedicated api/v1alpha1/job_types.go file
- Added generateEDAJobID() function for unique eda-webhook-N IDs
- Created comprehensive unit tests (69 tests passing, coverage: 41.5% controller, 66.1% provisioning)
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster (image: quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:9bd2073)
- Applied updated CRD to cluster with jobs array schema
- Updated osac-test-infra to use jobs array (commit a4c0262)
- Converted all kubectl jsonpath queries to jq with jobs array filtering
- Successfully tested EDA provider end-to-end (job IDs: eda-webhook-1, eda-webhook-2)
- Successfully tested AAP provider end-to-end (job IDs: 9076, 9079)
- Verified full job state tracking for AAP (Pending → Running → Succeeded)
- Ran latency experiment (3 parallel runs per provider, 6 total VMs)
- AAP Direct: 12% faster provision, 2% faster deprovision, 8.4% faster overall
- EDA: avg 147.7s provision, 83.7s deprovision, 231.3s total
- Tested delete-during-provision scenario (provision job canceled, single deprovision job created)
- Verified no performance degradation from jobs array schema change
- Created MEMORY.md files in cloudkit-operator and ~/.claude/ for workflow documentation

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Implemented and validated status.jobs[] array refactoring with comprehensive testing across both EDA and AAP providers
