## Accomplishments
- Completed status.jobs[] array refactoring implementation for [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) based on PR review feedback
- Delivered 6 commits implementing jobs array pattern: API changes, infrastructure setup, controller helpers, AAP provider update, comprehensive refactoring, and EDA job ID generation
- All 69 unit tests passing with increased coverage (controller: 41.5%, provisioning: 66.1%)
- Successfully deployed operator image quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:9bd2073 to vmaas-dev cluster with updated CRD
- Updated osac-test-infra to use jobs array with jq-based queries (commit a4c0262)
- Validated both providers end-to-end: EDA (eda-webhook-1, eda-webhook-2) and AAP (jobs 9076, 9079) with full state tracking
- Completed performance experiment: 6 parallel VMs (3 per provider), AAP 8.4% faster overall with no performance degradation from jobs array
- Successfully tested delete-during-provision scenario: provision job canceled, single deprovision job created, no orphaned resources
- Created MEMORY.md documentation for CRD regeneration workflow and daily status management
- Consolidated JobState type to single source of truth in v1alpha1 package, organized job types in dedicated file
