# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Completed status.jobs[] array refactoring implementation across 7 commits in [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031)
- Added JobType enum (provision, deprovision) and JobState enum with comprehensive tests
- Refactored JobStatus struct with required fields (JobID, Type, Timestamp, State)
- Implemented configurable max job history (CLOUDKIT_MAX_JOB_HISTORY env var, default 10)
- Added controller helper functions (FindLatestJobByType, appendJob, updateJob) with full unit test coverage
- Updated AAP provider to use jobs array with v1alpha1.JobState
- Implemented EDA job ID generation (eda-webhook-N pattern with auto-increment)
- Consolidated JobState to single source of truth in v1alpha1 package
- Organized job types into dedicated api/v1alpha1/job_types.go file
- Refactored JobState tests using Ginkgo DescribeTable pattern (reduced from 59 to 28 lines)
- All 69 unit tests passing with clean linter (coverage: controller 41.5%, provisioning 66.1%)
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster (image: quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:9bd2073)
- Applied updated CRD with jobs array schema to cluster
- Updated osac-test-infra to use jobs array (converted kubectl jsonpath to jq queries)
- Committed test infrastructure changes (osac-test-infra a4c0262)
- Successfully tested EDA provider end-to-end (jobs: eda-webhook-1, eda-webhook-2)
- Successfully tested AAP Direct provider end-to-end (jobs: 9076, 9079 with full state tracking)
- Verified full job state transitions for AAP (Pending → Running → Succeeded)
- Verified UTC timestamps in jobs array (2026-02-12T09:55:26Z format)
- Completed performance testing (3 parallel runs per provider, 6 VMs total)
- AAP provider 12% faster provisioning, 2% faster deprovisioning vs EDA
- No performance regression from jobs array implementation
- Tested complex delete-during-provision scenario (provision job canceled, single deprovision job)
- Validated no duplicate jobs or orphaned resources
- Updated PR #102 description with comprehensive implementation details and test results
- Created MEMORY.md in cloudkit-operator (CRD regeneration workflow)
- Created ~/.claude/MEMORY.md (daily status file management guidelines)

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Jobs array pattern implementation with comprehensive testing across both AAP Direct and EDA providers
