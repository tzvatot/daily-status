# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Completed status.jobs[] array refactoring implementation ([discussion](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102#discussion_r2793270994))
- Created 6 commits implementing jobs array pattern (API changes, infrastructure, controller helpers, provider updates, EDA job ID generation)
- Added comprehensive unit tests - all 69 tests passing (coverage: 41.5% controller, 66.1% provisioning)
- Successfully deployed and tested with both EDA and AAP providers on vmaas-dev cluster
- EDA provider: Validated unique job ID generation (eda-webhook-1, eda-webhook-2)
- AAP provider: Verified real Ansible Controller job IDs (9076, 9079) and full state tracking (Pending → Running → Succeeded)
- Updated osac-test-infra to use jobs array (commit a4c0262) - all kubectl queries converted to jq
- Completed performance testing: 6 parallel VMs (3 per provider) - AAP 8.4% faster overall, no performance regression from jobs array
- Validated complex scenario: delete during provision - proper job cancellation and no duplicate jobs
- Created MEMORY.md files for CRD regeneration workflow and daily status management

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Successfully implemented and validated breaking API change replacing separate provisionJob/deprovisionJob fields with unified jobs[] array across both EDA and AAP providers.
