# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Implemented status.jobs[] array pattern for [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) (7 commits: API changes, infrastructure, controller helpers, AAP provider, EDA provider, job ID generation, test refactoring)
- Added JobType/JobState enums and refactored JobStatus struct with required fields (JobID, Type, Timestamp, State)
- Implemented configurable max job history (CLOUDKIT_MAX_JOB_HISTORY env var, default 10)
- Consolidated JobState type to single source of truth in v1alpha1 package (eliminated duplication)
- Organized job types in dedicated api/v1alpha1/job_types.go file with comprehensive unit tests
- Implemented EDA job ID generation (eda-webhook-N pattern with automatic incrementing)
- Updated all controller helpers (FindLatestJobByType, findJobByID, appendJob, updateJob) with full unit test coverage
- Achieved 69 passing tests with 41.5% controller coverage and 66.1% provisioning coverage
- Deployed operator image quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:9bd2073 to vmaas-dev cluster
- Applied updated CRD to cluster (jobs array schema active, old fields removed)
- Updated osac-test-infra roles/playbooks to use jobs array with jq-based filtering (commit a4c0262)
- Completed E2E testing with EDA provider (jobs: eda-webhook-1, eda-webhook-2)
- Completed E2E testing with AAP provider (jobs: 9076, 9079) with full state tracking (Pending → Running → Succeeded)
- Completed performance testing (3 parallel runs per provider, 6 VMs total): AAP 12% faster provisioning, 2% faster deprovisioning, 8.4% faster overall
- Completed delete-during-provision test (provision job canceled, single deprovision job, no orphans)
- Updated [PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) description with comprehensive jobs array implementation details
- Created MEMORY.md files (cloudkit-operator project + global ~/.claude/MEMORY.md) documenting CRD regeneration workflow and daily status update strategy

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Successfully implemented and validated status.jobs[] array refactoring across EDA and AAP providers with comprehensive testing (69 unit tests, E2E tests, performance testing, complex scenarios)
