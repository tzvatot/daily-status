# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Completed status.jobs[] array refactoring implementation ([MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031)) with 9 commits
- Added JobType enum (provision, deprovision) and JobState enum (Pending, Waiting, Running, Succeeded, Failed, Canceled, Unknown)
- Refactored JobStatus struct with JobID, Type, Timestamp fields and jobs[] array in ComputeInstanceStatus
- Implemented configurable max job history via CLOUDKIT_MAX_JOB_HISTORY env var (default: 10)
- Added controller helper functions: FindLatestJobByType(), appendJob(), updateJob() with comprehensive unit tests
- Implemented EDA provider job ID generation (eda-webhook-N pattern) with auto-incrementing logic
- Fixed critical bugs: AAP provider handling of EDA job IDs and Deleting phase with no deprovision job
- Achieved 100% test pass rate (69 tests), linter clean, coverage: 41.5% controller, 66.1% provisioning
- Deployed to vmaas-dev cluster (image: quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:beec750) and applied updated CRD
- Updated osac-test-infra to use jobs array with jq-based filtering (commit a4c0262)
- Successfully tested AAP Direct provider (jobs: 9076, 9079) and EDA provider (jobs: eda-webhook-1, eda-webhook-2)
- Completed performance testing: 6 parallel VMs (3 AAP, 3 EDA), AAP 8.4% faster overall, no performance regression
- Validated delete-during-provision scenario: job cancellation, no duplicates, proper cleanup
- **Successfully completed provider switch test**: EDA provision (eda-webhook-1) → AAP deprovision (9219) with mixed provider types in jobs array
- Updated PR #102 description with comprehensive jobs array implementation details and test results
- Fixed shellcheck errors in osac-test-infra (commits d78c030, 4fe6989) - added set -o pipefail to shell commands
- Updated AAP provisioning documentation for jobs array migration (osac-docs commit 778d3e9) - migrated all examples, updated sequence diagrams, regenerated PNG images

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Implementing and validating status.jobs[] array pattern to replace separate ProvisionJob/DeprovisionJob fields, with comprehensive testing across AAP and EDA providers including mixed-provider lifecycle scenarios.
