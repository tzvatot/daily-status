# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Completed status.jobs[] array refactoring implementing PR [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) review feedback with 9 commits (76a982d, 6a8e60b, 43b22a4, c228c6d, 7116de5, 9bd2073, 18a7d7d, 1d5dab3, beec750)
- Added JobType enum (provision, deprovision) and JobState enum with validation methods
- Refactored JobStatus struct with JobID, Type, Timestamp, and State fields
- Implemented configurable max job history via CLOUDKIT_MAX_JOB_HISTORY environment variable
- Created controller helper functions (FindLatestJobByType, appendJob, updateJob, findJobByID) with full unit test coverage
- Generated unique EDA job IDs (eda-webhook-N pattern) with comprehensive edge case testing
- Fixed critical bug handling EDA job IDs in AAP provider (commit 1d5dab3)
- Fixed critical bug handling Deleting phase when no deprovision job exists (commit beec750)
- Achieved 69 passing unit tests with 41.5% controller coverage and 66.1% provisioning coverage
- Successfully deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster with updated CRD (image: quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:beec750)
- Updated osac-test-infra roles and playbooks to use jobs array with jq-based queries (commit a4c0262)
- Validated EDA provider end-to-end test (jobs: eda-webhook-1, eda-webhook-2)
- Validated AAP Direct provider end-to-end test with full state tracking (jobs: 9076, 9079, states: Pending → Running → Succeeded)
- Completed performance testing with 6 parallel VMs showing AAP 8.4% faster than EDA with no jobs array regression
- Successfully tested delete-during-provision scenario with job cancellation and state tracking
- Validated provider switch scenario (EDA provision → AAP deprovision) with mixed job types in array (eda-webhook-1 + 9219)
- Updated PR [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) description with comprehensive jobs array implementation details
- Fixed shellcheck errors in osac-test-infra playbook by adding pipefail to shell commands (commit d78c030)

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Implementing and validating status.jobs[] array pattern as provider-agnostic job tracking mechanism replacing separate ProvisionJob/DeprovisionJob fields
