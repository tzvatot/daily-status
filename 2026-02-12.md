# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Implemented status.jobs[] array refactoring based on [PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) review feedback (9 commits total)
- Added API changes: JobType enum, JobState enum, refactored JobStatus struct, replaced ProvisionJob/DeprovisionJob with Jobs[] array
- Implemented configurable max job history via CLOUDKIT_MAX_JOB_HISTORY env var (default: 10)
- Added controller helper functions: FindLatestJobByType(), findJobByID(), appendJob(), updateJob()
- Refactored handleProvisioning() and handleDeprovisioning() to use jobs array pattern
- Updated AAP provider to use FindLatestJobByType() helper and jobs array
- Implemented EDA provider generateEDAJobID() function for unique eda-webhook-N job IDs
- Fixed AAP provider to handle EDA job IDs in provider switch scenarios (commits 1d5dab3, beec750)
- Created comprehensive unit tests for job types and controller helpers (69 tests passing, coverage: 66.1% provisioning, 41.5% controller)
- Updated test infrastructure (osac-test-infra) to use jobs array with jq-based filtering (commit a4c0262)
- Successfully tested AAP Direct provider end-to-end (job IDs: 9076, 9079) with full state tracking (Pending → Running → Succeeded)
- Successfully tested EDA provider end-to-end (job IDs: eda-webhook-1, eda-webhook-2) with incremental ID generation
- Ran performance experiment: 3 parallel runs per provider (6 VMs total), AAP 8.4% faster overall (212s vs 231s), no jobs array performance regression
- Tested complex delete-during-provision scenario: verified provision job cancellation, single deprovision job, no orphaned resources
- Successfully validated provider switch scenario: EDA provision (eda-webhook-1) → AAP deprovision (9219) with mixed provider types in jobs array
- Fixed shellcheck errors in osac-test-infra: added `set -o pipefail` to shell commands (commits d78c030, 4fe6989)
- Updated AAP provisioning documentation (osac-docs [PR #20](https://github.com/osac-project/docs/pull/20)) for jobs array migration: migrated kubectl examples to jq filtering, updated sequence diagrams, regenerated PNG images (commit 778d3e9)
- Built and deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster (images: quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:9bd2073, beec750)
- Applied updated CRD with jobs array schema to cluster
- Updated [PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) description with comprehensive jobs array implementation details, E2E test results, and performance analysis
- Created MEMORY.md files for CRD regeneration workflow and daily status file management

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Completed status.jobs[] array refactoring with comprehensive testing across both AAP and EDA providers, including provider switch validation
