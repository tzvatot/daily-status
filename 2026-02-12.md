# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Implemented status.jobs[] array refactoring for [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) based on [PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) review feedback
- Completed 9 commits implementing jobs array pattern: API changes, infrastructure (configurable max job history), controller helpers, provider updates, linter fixes, and provider switch fixes (commits 76a982d through beec750)
- Added JobType and JobState enums, refactored JobStatus struct, replaced ProvisionJob/DeprovisionJob with Jobs[] array
- Implemented EDA job ID generation (eda-webhook-N pattern) with comprehensive test coverage (coverage increased from 63.8% to 66.1%)
- Fixed critical provider switch bugs: handle EDA job IDs in AAP provider (commit 1d5dab3), handle Deleting phase when no deprovision job exists (commit beec750)
- Successfully tested both AAP Direct and EDA providers end-to-end with jobs array implementation
- Conducted performance testing: 3 parallel runs per provider (6 VMs total) - AAP 12% faster provision, 2% faster deprovision, no performance regression from jobs array
- Validated delete-during-provision scenario: provision job correctly canceled, single deprovision job created, no orphaned resources
- **Successfully validated provider switch scenario**: EDA provision → AAP deprovision working perfectly (vm-4nl9s with eda-webhook-1 provision + job 9219 deprovision in same jobs array)
- Updated osac-test-infra to use jobs array pattern with jq-based filtering (commit a4c0262)
- Fixed shellcheck errors in osac-test-infra: added `set -o pipefail` to shell commands (commits d78c030, 4fe6989)
- Deployed and tested on vmaas-dev cluster with image quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:beec750
- Updated [PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) description with comprehensive implementation details
- All 69 unit tests passing, linter clean, CRD manifests generated and applied to cluster

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Completed status.jobs[] array refactoring implementation with comprehensive testing across both AAP and EDA providers, including successful validation of mixed-provider lifecycle scenarios
