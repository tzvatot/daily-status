# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Implemented status.jobs[] array pattern based on [PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) review feedback
- Completed API changes: Added JobType and JobState enums, refactored JobStatus struct with JobID/Type/Timestamp fields, replaced ProvisionJob/DeprovisionJob with Jobs array
- Implemented infrastructure for configurable max job history via CLOUDKIT_MAX_JOB_HISTORY env var
- Added controller helper functions: FindLatestJobByType, findJobByID, appendJob, updateJob
- Refactored handleProvisioning() and handleDeprovisioning() to use jobs array
- Consolidated JobState type: Removed duplicate from provisioning package, using v1alpha1.JobState as single source of truth
- Organized job types into dedicated api/v1alpha1/job_types.go file with comprehensive unit tests
- Updated AAP provider to use jobs array and v1alpha1.JobState throughout
- Updated controller and provider test files to use cloudkitv1alpha1.JobState

## Risks & Challenges
- EDA provider still needs job ID generation logic implementation
- Test files require updates to use jobs array in assertions
- Need to run make generate to update CRDs and deepcopy before compilation verification
- Full validation pending: tests, linting, build, and deployment to test environment

## Key Effort
Implementing status.jobs[] array refactoring across controller and providers with JobState type consolidation
