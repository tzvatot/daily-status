# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Completed status.jobs[] array refactoring implementation ([PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102))
  - Implemented 9 commits including API changes, infrastructure, controller helpers, provider updates, and critical bug fixes
  - All 69 unit tests passing with coverage at 41.5% (controller) and 66.1% (provisioning)
  - Linter clean, all compilation successful
- Deployed jobs array implementation to vmaas-dev cluster
  - Built and deployed operator image (quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:beec750)
  - Applied updated CRD with jobs array schema
  - MaxJobHistory=10 configured and working
- Updated osac-test-infra to use jobs array pattern
  - Converted all kubectl jsonpath queries to jq with jobs array filtering
  - Committed changes (a4c0262) to support both AAP and EDA providers
  - Fixed shellcheck errors in playbooks and roles (commits d78c030, 4fe6989)
- Completed comprehensive integration testing
  - **AAP Provider**: Jobs 9076 (provision), 9079 (deprovision) with full state tracking (Pending → Running → Succeeded)
  - **EDA Provider**: Jobs eda-webhook-1, eda-webhook-2 with incremental ID generation
  - **Performance Testing**: 6 parallel VMs (3 per provider), AAP 8.4% faster overall, no performance regression from jobs array
  - **Delete During Provision**: Complex scenario validated - provision job canceled, single deprovision job created, no orphaned resources
  - **Provider Switch Test (MAJOR)**: EDA provision (eda-webhook-1) → AAP deprovision (9219) successfully validated mixed-provider lifecycle
- Fixed critical provider switch bugs
  - Commit 1d5dab3: Handle EDA job IDs in AAP provider (isReadyForDeprovision detection)
  - Commit beec750: Handle Deleting phase when no deprovision job exists yet
  - Enables seamless provider switching mid-lifecycle
- Updated [PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) description with comprehensive implementation details
  - Highlighted jobs array pattern benefits and breaking changes
  - Included E2E test results for both providers
  - Added performance testing results and migration path
- Created MEMORY.md documentation files
  - cloudkit-operator: CRD regeneration workflow and schema change reminders
  - ~/.claude/MEMORY.md: Daily status file management guidelines

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Completed status.jobs[] array refactoring with comprehensive testing across both AAP and EDA providers, including successful validation of mixed-provider lifecycle (EDA provision → AAP deprovision).
