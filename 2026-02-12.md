# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Implemented status.jobs[] array refactoring across osac-operator codebase (9 commits: 76a982d, 6a8e60b, 43b22a4, c228c6d, 7116de5, 9bd2073, 18a7d7d, 1d5dab3, beec750)
- Added JobType enum (provision/deprovision) and JobState enum (Pending/Waiting/Running/Succeeded/Failed/Canceled/Unknown) to API
- Refactored JobStatus struct with required fields (JobID, Type, Timestamp, State)
- Replaced separate ProvisionJob/DeprovisionJob fields with unified Jobs []JobStatus array
- Implemented configurable max job history (CLOUDKIT_MAX_JOB_HISTORY env var, default 10)
- Created controller helper functions (FindLatestJobByType, appendJob, updateJob, findJobByID)
- Consolidated JobState type (single source of truth in v1alpha1 package)
- Organized job types in dedicated api/v1alpha1/job_types.go file
- Implemented EDA job ID generation (eda-webhook-N pattern with auto-incrementing counter)
- Added comprehensive unit tests (69 passing, coverage: 41.5% controller, 66.1% provisioning)
- Fixed provider switch scenario bugs ([MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031))
- Built and deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster (image: quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:beec750)
- Applied updated CRD with jobs[] array schema to cluster
- Updated osac-test-infra to use jobs array pattern (commit a4c0262)
- Converted all kubectl jsonpath queries to jq-based jobs array filtering
- Successfully tested AAP Direct provider end-to-end (provision job 9076, deprovision job 9079)
- Successfully tested EDA provider end-to-end (jobs eda-webhook-1, eda-webhook-2)
- Completed performance experiment (6 VMs total, 3 runs per provider)
- Successfully tested delete-during-provision scenario (provision job 9102 canceled, deprovision job 9104)
- Successfully tested provider switch scenario (EDA provision eda-webhook-1 → AAP deprovision 9219)
- Fixed shellcheck errors in osac-test-infra (commits d78c030, 4fe6989)
- Updated AAP provisioning documentation for jobs array migration (osac-docs commit 778d3e9)
- Updated PR [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) #102 description with comprehensive implementation details

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Successfully implemented and validated status.jobs[] array pattern replacing separate ProvisionJob/DeprovisionJob fields, including mixed-provider lifecycle support and comprehensive end-to-end testing.
