# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Implemented status.jobs[] array refactoring for osac-operator based on PR [MGMT-102](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-102) review feedback
- Completed API changes: Added JobType and JobState enums, refactored JobStatus struct, replaced ProvisionJob/DeprovisionJob with Jobs[] array
- Implemented configurable max job history via CLOUDKIT_MAX_JOB_HISTORY env var with validation
- Added controller helper functions: FindLatestJobByType(), findJobByID(), appendJob(), updateJob()
- Refactored handleProvisioning() and handleDeprovisioning() to use jobs array with UTC timestamps
- Updated AAP provider to use jobs array and v1alpha1.JobState
- Consolidated JobState type (single source of truth in v1alpha1, removed duplicate from provisioning package)
- Organized job types into dedicated api/v1alpha1/job_types.go file with comprehensive unit tests
- Fixed import cycle by moving FindLatestJobByType to v1alpha1 package
- Updated all controller and provider test files to use jobs array pattern
- All tests passing (52/52), linter clean, successful compilation

## Risks & Challenges
- EDA provider still needs job ID generation logic (eda-webhook-N pattern with counter) before testing
- Pending validation in test environment for both AAP Direct and EDA providers
- Awaiting PR review feedback from @adriengentil on jobs array implementation

## Key Effort
Implementing and testing status.jobs[] array pattern to replace individual ProvisionJob/DeprovisionJob fields across controller and providers
