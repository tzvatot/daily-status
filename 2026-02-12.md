# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Completed status.jobs[] array refactoring implementation (7 commits) for [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031)
  - Added JobType/JobState enums and refactored JobStatus struct with required fields (jobID, type, timestamp, state)
  - Implemented configurable max job history (CLOUDKIT_MAX_JOB_HISTORY env var, default 10)
  - Added controller helpers: FindLatestJobByType(), appendJob(), updateJob() with full unit test coverage
  - Updated AAP provider to use jobs array and FindLatestJobByType helper
  - Consolidated JobState type to single source of truth in v1alpha1 package
  - Implemented EDA job ID generation (eda-webhook-N pattern) with comprehensive tests
  - Refactored tests to Ginkgo DescribeTable pattern (eliminated duplication)
- Successfully deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster (image: quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:9bd2073)
- Applied updated CRD to cluster with jobs array schema
- Updated osac-test-infra to use jobs array pattern (all kubectl queries converted to jq)
- Completed comprehensive integration testing:
  - EDA provider: eda-webhook-1, eda-webhook-2 (incremental job IDs)
  - AAP provider: full job state tracking (Pending → Running → Succeeded) with real Ansible Controller job IDs
  - Performance testing: 3 parallel runs per provider (6 VMs total) - AAP 8.4% faster overall, no jobs array performance regression
  - Delete during provision scenario: verified job cancellation and single deprovision job creation
- Updated [PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) description with comprehensive jobs array implementation details
- Committed osac-test-infra changes (a4c0262) with updated roles and playbooks
- All 69 unit tests passing (coverage: 41.5% controller, 66.1% provisioning)
- Linter clean, no code duplication warnings

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Implementing and validating status.jobs[] array refactoring with comprehensive testing across both EDA and AAP providers
