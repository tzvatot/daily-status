# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Completed status.jobs[] array refactoring implementation with 7 commits (API changes, infrastructure, controller helpers, provider updates, EDA job ID generation, linter fixes)
- Added JobType and JobState enums, refactored JobStatus struct with JobID/Type/Timestamp fields
- Implemented configurable max job history with CLOUDKIT_MAX_JOB_HISTORY env var and helper functions (FindLatestJobByType, appendJob, updateJob, generateEDAJobID)
- Successfully deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster (image: quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:9bd2073) and applied updated CRD
- End-to-end testing passed for both EDA provider (job IDs: eda-webhook-1, eda-webhook-2) and AAP Direct provider (job IDs: 9076, 9079) with full job state tracking
- Performance testing completed: 6 parallel VMs (3 per provider), AAP 8.4% faster overall, zero performance regression from jobs array
- Complex scenario testing validated: delete-during-provision properly canceled provision job before starting deprovision, no duplicate jobs
- Updated osac-test-infra repository with jobs array queries (commit a4c0262) - all kubectl jsonpath queries converted to jq with job type filtering
- Updated PR [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) description with comprehensive jobs array implementation details, test results, and migration notes
- All 69 unit tests passing with comprehensive coverage for job helpers and state transitions
- Created MEMORY.md documentation for CRD regeneration workflow and daily status management practices
