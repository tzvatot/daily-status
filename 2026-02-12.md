# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Completed status.jobs[] array refactoring implementation (6 commits) based on [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) PR review feedback
- Added JobType and JobState enums with status.jobs[] array replacing separate provisionJob/deprovisionJob fields
- Implemented configurable max job history via CLOUDKIT_MAX_JOB_HISTORY env var (default: 10)
- Added helper functions: FindLatestJobByType(), findJobByID(), appendJob(), updateJob() with full unit test coverage
- Consolidated JobState type as single source of truth in v1alpha1 package, organized job types in dedicated file
- Implemented EDA job ID generation (eda-webhook-N pattern) with comprehensive tests
- Successfully deployed to vmaas-dev cluster (image: quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:9bd2073) with updated CRD
- End-to-end testing passed for both providers: EDA (eda-webhook-1, eda-webhook-2) and AAP Direct (job IDs 9076, 9079)
- Updated osac-test-infra to use jobs array (commit a4c0262) - all kubectl jsonpath queries converted to jq with jobs array filtering
- Ran performance experiment: AAP Direct is 12% faster for provisioning (130s vs 148s), 2% faster for deprovisioning - jobs array has zero performance impact
- All 69 unit tests passing with linter clean (coverage: 41.5% controller, 66.1% provisioning)
- Created MEMORY.md documentation for CRD regeneration workflow and daily status file management

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Completed status.jobs[] array refactoring with full implementation, deployment, and integration testing across both EDA and AAP providers
