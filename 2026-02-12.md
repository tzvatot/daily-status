# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Completed status.jobs[] array refactoring implementation (6 commits total)
  - API changes: Added JobType/JobState enums, refactored JobStatus struct, replaced ProvisionJob/DeprovisionJob with Jobs[] array ([MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031))
  - Infrastructure: Implemented configurable max job history via CLOUDKIT_MAX_JOB_HISTORY env var
  - Controller helpers: Added FindLatestJobByType(), findJobByID(), appendJob(), updateJob() with full unit test coverage
  - AAP provider: Updated to use jobs array pattern and FindLatestJobByType helper
  - Jobs array refactoring: Consolidated JobState type, moved job types to dedicated job_types.go file, updated all test files
  - EDA job ID generation: Implemented generateEDAJobID() for unique eda-webhook-N IDs with comprehensive tests
- Increased test coverage from 63.8% to 66.1% with 69 passing unit tests
- Successfully deployed to vmaas-dev cluster (image: quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:9bd2073)
- Updated CRD manifests and applied to cluster (jobs array schema active)
- Updated osac-test-infra repository to use jobs array queries (commit a4c0262)
  - Converted all kubectl jsonpath queries to jq with jobs array filtering
  - Tested with both EDA and AAP providers successfully
- Completed end-to-end integration testing for both providers
  - EDA provider: Verified eda-webhook-1, eda-webhook-2 job ID generation and full lifecycle
  - AAP provider: Verified job IDs 9076, 9079 with full state tracking (Pending → Running → Succeeded)
- Ran performance experiment with 3 parallel runs per provider (6 VMs total)
  - AAP Direct: 212.0s average (130.0s provision, 82.0s deprovision)
  - EDA: 231.3s average (147.7s provision, 83.7s deprovision)
  - AAP is 8.4% faster overall, jobs array has zero performance impact
- Tested complex delete-during-provision scenario successfully
  - Verified provision job cancellation before deprovision starts
  - Confirmed single deprovision job creation (no duplicates)
  - Validated complete cleanup with no orphaned resources
- Created MEMORY.md files for both cloudkit-operator project and global ~/.claude/ directory

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
