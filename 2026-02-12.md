# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Completed status.jobs[] array refactoring implementation for [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) (7 commits: 76a982d, 6a8e60b, 43b22a4, c228c6d, 7116de5, 9bd2073, 18a7d7d)
- Implemented JobType/JobState enums and refactored JobStatus struct with JobID, Type, Timestamp fields
- Added configurable max job history (CLOUDKIT_MAX_JOB_HISTORY env var, default=10) with helper functions
- Consolidated JobState type to single source of truth in v1alpha1 package
- Implemented EDA job ID generation (eda-webhook-N pattern) with comprehensive tests
- Updated controller and both AAP/EDA providers to use jobs array pattern
- Achieved 69 passing unit tests with linter clean
- Successfully deployed to vmaas-dev cluster (image: quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:9bd2073)
- Applied updated CRD to cluster with jobs array schema
- Updated osac-test-infra (commit a4c0262) to use jq-based jobs array queries
- Completed comprehensive E2E testing: AAP provider (job IDs: 9076, 9079) and EDA provider (job IDs: eda-webhook-1, eda-webhook-2)
- Ran performance testing with 3 parallel runs per provider (6 VMs total): AAP 12% faster provisioning, 8.4% faster overall
- Validated delete-during-provision scenario with proper job cancellation and cleanup
- Updated PR #102 description with comprehensive jobs array implementation details
- Created MEMORY.md in cloudkit-operator project documenting CRD regeneration workflow
- Created ~/.claude/MEMORY.md with global daily status management instructions

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Implementing and validating status.jobs[] array pattern to replace separate ProvisionJob/DeprovisionJob fields, with full E2E testing across both AAP and EDA providers
