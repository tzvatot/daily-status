# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Completed status.jobs[] array refactoring ([PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102)):
  - Added JobType and JobState enums with required fields (JobID, Type, Timestamp, State)
  - Replaced ProvisionJob/DeprovisionJob with Jobs array in ComputeInstanceStatus
  - Implemented configurable max job history via CLOUDKIT_MAX_JOB_HISTORY env var
  - Added controller helper functions (FindLatestJobByType, appendJob, updateJob)
  - Refactored handleProvisioning() and handleDeprovisioning() to use jobs array
  - Consolidated JobState type - single source of truth in v1alpha1 package
  - Organized job types into dedicated api/v1alpha1/job_types.go file with comprehensive unit tests
  - Updated AAP provider to use v1alpha1.JobState and FindLatestJobByType helper
  - Updated all controller and provider test files to use new jobs array structure
  - All tests passing (52/52), linter clean, compilation successful

## Risks & Challenges
- EDA provider still needs job ID generation logic (eda-webhook-N pattern) before final validation
- Need to deploy to test environment and verify both AAP Direct and EDA providers work correctly
- Awaiting PR feedback from @adriengentil on jobs array pattern proposal

## Key Effort
Implementing and testing status.jobs[] array refactoring based on PR review feedback with UTC timestamps and configurable job history
