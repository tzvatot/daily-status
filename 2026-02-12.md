# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Completed status.jobs[] array refactoring implementation based on [PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) review feedback
- Implemented 6 commits covering API changes, infrastructure, controller helpers, provider updates, and EDA job ID generation
- Added JobType and JobState enums, refactored JobStatus struct with JobID, Type, Timestamp, State fields
- Implemented configurable max job history via CLOUDKIT_MAX_JOB_HISTORY env var with parseIntEnv() validation
- Added controller helper functions: FindLatestJobByType(), findJobByID(), appendJob(), updateJob() with full unit test coverage
- Consolidated JobState type to v1alpha1 as single source of truth across codebase
- Organized job types in dedicated api/v1alpha1/job_types.go file with comprehensive tests
- Updated AAP provider to use jobs array and FindLatestJobByType() helper
- Implemented generateEDAJobID() function for unique eda-webhook-N job IDs with edge case testing
- All 69 tests passing, linter clean, coverage increased from 63.8% to 66.1%
- Deployed operator image to vmaas-dev cluster (quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:9bd2073)
- Applied updated CRD to cluster with jobs[] array schema
- End-to-end test passed successfully: created vm-n88nh with provision job eda-webhook-1, deprovision job eda-webhook-2, verified jobs array population
- Updated osac-test-infra roles and playbooks to use jobs array with jq queries (WIP, not committed)
- Created MEMORY.md in cloudkit-operator documenting CRD regeneration workflow
- Created ~/.claude/MEMORY.md with daily status file management guidelines

## Risks & Challenges
- Test infrastructure validation pending (need to run create_ci.sh to verify updated playbooks)
- Integration testing with AAP Direct and EDA providers not yet completed
- Breaking changes require migration path communication in PR

## Key Effort
Completed end-to-end implementation of status.jobs[] array pattern with configurable history, EDA job ID generation, and successful deployment to test cluster.
