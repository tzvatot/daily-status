- Deployed updated operator to vmaas-dev cluster (image: quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:9bd2073)
- Applied updated CRD with jobs array schema to cluster
- Updated osac-test-infra to use jobs array pattern (commit a4c0262)
- End-to-end integration testing passed for both EDA provider (job IDs: eda-webhook-1, eda-webhook-2) and AAP provider (job IDs: 9076, 9079)
- Ran performance experiment with 3 parallel runs per provider (6 VMs total): AAP Direct 8.4% faster overall (212s vs 231s)
- Complex scenario testing passed: delete during provision with correct job cancellation (provision job 9102 → Canceled, deprovision job 9104)
- All 69 unit tests passing with increased coverage (controller: 41.5%, provisioning: 66.1%)
- Created MEMORY.md documents in both cloudkit-operator project and ~/.claude/ for workflow documentation
