# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Completed status.jobs[] array refactoring implementation with 7 commits (all tests passing, linter clean)
- Added JobType/JobState enums and refactored JobStatus struct with required JobID, Type, Timestamp fields
- Implemented configurable max job history via CLOUDKIT_MAX_JOB_HISTORY env var (default: 10)
- Created controller helper functions (FindLatestJobByType, appendJob, updateJob) with comprehensive unit test coverage
- Refactored AAP provider to use jobs array with FindLatestJobByType helper
- Implemented EDA job ID generation (eda-webhook-N pattern) with auto-incrementing logic
- Consolidated JobState type to single source of truth in v1alpha1 package
- Deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster (image: quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:9bd2073) and applied updated CRD
- Updated osac-test-infra to use jobs array queries (committed a4c0262)
- Validated end-to-end with EDA provider (jobs: eda-webhook-1, eda-webhook-2) and AAP provider (jobs: 9076, 9079)
- Ran performance experiment: 3 parallel runs per provider showing AAP 12% faster provisioning, no jobs array performance impact
- Tested delete-during-provision scenario: verified provision job cancellation and single deprovision job creation
- Updated [PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) description with comprehensive jobs array implementation details
- Created MEMORY.md in cloudkit-operator project documenting CRD regeneration workflow
- Created ~/.claude/MEMORY.md with global instructions for daily status file management

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Implementing and validating status.jobs[] array pattern to replace separate ProvisionJob/DeprovisionJob fields with comprehensive testing across both AAP and EDA providers.
