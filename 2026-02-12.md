# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Completed status.jobs[] array refactoring implementation with 9 commits across API, controller, and providers
- Implemented provider-agnostic job tracking with `JobType` enum (provision/deprovision) and `JobState` enum (Pending/Waiting/Running/Succeeded/Failed/Canceled/Unknown)
- Added configurable max job history (CLOUDKIT_MAX_JOB_HISTORY env var, default 10) with automatic trimming
- Implemented EDA job ID generation (eda-webhook-N pattern) with comprehensive unit tests
- Fixed critical bugs enabling provider switching mid-lifecycle ([MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031))
- Consolidated JobState type to v1alpha1 package as single source of truth, organized job types in dedicated api/v1alpha1/job_types.go file
- Achieved 69 passing unit tests with comprehensive coverage of helper functions (FindLatestJobByType, appendJob, updateJob, findJobByID, generateEDAJobID)
- Deployed and validated on vmaas-dev cluster (image: quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:beec750)
- Successfully tested both AAP Direct and EDA providers with jobs array tracking
- Validated provider switch scenario (EDA provision → AAP deprovision) - jobs array correctly contains both eda-webhook-1 and numeric AAP job ID 9219
- Ran performance experiment with 6 parallel VMs (3 AAP, 3 EDA) - no performance regression from jobs array implementation, AAP 12% faster provisioning
- Tested complex delete-during-provision scenario - verified single deprovision job creation, job cancellation, no orphaned resources
- Updated osac-test-infra to use jobs array with jq-based filtering (commit a4c0262)
- Fixed shellcheck errors in osac-test-infra playbooks and roles with set -o pipefail (commits d78c030, 4fe6989)
- Updated AAP provisioning documentation for jobs array migration with updated kubectl examples, sequence diagrams, and regenerated PNG images (osac-docs commit 778d3e9)
- Updated PR #102 description with comprehensive jobs array implementation details and test results

## Risks & Challenges
