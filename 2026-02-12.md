# Daily Status - 2026-02-12

## Accomplishments
- Implemented status.jobs[] array pattern based on [PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) review feedback (6 commits, 69 tests passing)
- Added `JobType` enum (provision, deprovision) and `JobState` enum (Pending, Waiting, Running, Succeeded, Failed, Canceled, Unknown)
- Refactored `JobStatus` struct with JobID, Type, Timestamp, and State fields; replaced separate ProvisionJob/DeprovisionJob fields
- Implemented configurable max job history via `CLOUDKIT_MAX_JOB_HISTORY` env var (default: 10)
- Added controller helper functions: `FindLatestJobByType()`, `findJobByID()`, `appendJob()`, `updateJob()` with full unit test coverage
- Updated AAP provider to use jobs array with `FindLatestJobByType` helper
- Implemented EDA job ID generation (`generateEDAJobID()`) creating unique eda-webhook-N IDs with comprehensive test coverage
- Consolidated JobState type to single source of truth in v1alpha1 package, moved job types to dedicated job_types.go file
- Successfully deployed operator to vmaas-dev cluster (image: quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:9bd2073) with updated CRD
- End-to-end testing passed with both providers: EDA (eda-webhook-1, eda-webhook-2) and AAP (job IDs 9076, 9079) with full state tracking
- Updated osac-test-infra to use jobs array pattern, converted all kubectl jsonpath queries to jq (commit a4c0262)
- Completed performance testing: 3 parallel runs per provider (6 VMs total), AAP 8.4% faster overall (212s vs 231s)
- Validated complex delete-during-provision scenario: provision job canceled before deprovision starts, no duplicate jobs, no orphaned resources
- Created MEMORY.md documentation for CRD regeneration workflow and daily status management

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Completed status.jobs[] array refactoring with comprehensive testing across both EDA and AAP providers, including performance validation and complex scenario testing
