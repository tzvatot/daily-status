# Daily Status - 2026-02-15

## Accomplishments
- Analyzed backward compatibility between public cloudkit-operator image (without jobs array) and new implementation (with jobs array) for [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031)
- Identified safe migration scenarios (Ready VMs, deprovisioning) and risk scenarios (Progressing state VMs, EDA finalizers)
- Deployed public osac-operator:latest image to vmaas-dev cluster for migration testing
- Created comprehensive migration test script (`test_migration.sh`) covering 10 phases with EDA and AAP provider testing
- Discovered and resolved CRD incompatibility (missing "Starting" phase) by rebasing feature branch from upstream/main
- Updated AAP provider code for new phase states (Progressing→Starting, Ready→Running) per commit 4087fdb
- Added comprehensive test coverage for provider switch scenarios (6 new test cases for `isReadyForDeprovision` with EDA provision jobs)
- Fixed all `time.Now()` calls to use UTC for timezone consistency across environments
- Updated `MEMORY.md` with Go UTC time handling requirement
- Increased provisioning package test coverage from 59.8% to 75.8% (all 69 tests passing)
- Created and pushed PR [#106](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/106) supporting provider switching from EDA to AAP during deprovision

## Risks & Challenges
- Migration risk identified: VMs in Progressing state during migration may trigger duplicate provision jobs
- EDA VMs without AAP finalizer may skip deprovision webhook (cleanup incomplete)
- Recommendation: Ensure all VMs reach Ready/terminal state before production migration

## Key Effort
Testing backward compatibility for jobs array migration and adding comprehensive provider switch handling with increased test coverage for AAP/EDA transition scenarios
