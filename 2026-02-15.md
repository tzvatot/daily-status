# Daily Status - 2026-02-15

## Accomplishments

- Code analysis for backward compatibility in migration from public image to jobs array implementation
- Rebased feature branch from upstream/main to resolve CRD incompatibility with new phase states (Starting, Running vs. Progressing, Ready)
- Updated AAP provider code to support new phase states ([MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031))
- Added comprehensive test coverage for provider switch scenarios (6 new test cases, coverage increased from 59.8% to 75.8%)
- Fixed all time.Now() calls to use UTC for consistency across environments
- Created and updated [PR #106](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/106) supporting provider switching from EDA to AAP during deprovision
- Refactored EDA job ID validation logic to consolidate in EDA provider (better separation of concerns)
- Fixed vmaas-dev EDA webhook configuration (HTTP 405 errors resolved by switching to innabox-eda-service endpoints)
- Enhanced migration test script with timestamped logging and created continuation script for partial test execution
- Discovered critical issue: public operator image (ghcr.io/osac-project/osac-operator:latest) already includes jobs array feature, blocking true migration testing

## Risks & Challenges

- Migration test currently blocked - need to identify and deploy a truly old operator image (before jobs array was added) to properly test backward compatibility scenario
- VMs created during testing (vm-vkc5m, vm-bltt6) already have jobs array in status, cannot be used to test migration from old to new implementation

## Key Effort

Supporting provider switching from EDA to AAP during deprovision with comprehensive test coverage, resolving CRD compatibility issues through upstream rebase, and preparing migration testing infrastructure
