# Daily Status - 2026-02-15

## Accomplishments
- Deployed public cloudkit-operator image (ghcr.io/osac-project/osac-operator:latest) to vmaas-dev cluster for backward compatibility testing related to [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031)
- Analyzed code for backward compatibility when migrating from operator without jobs array to new implementation (PR [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102))
- Identified safe migration scenarios: Ready VMs with matching config versions, deprovisioning Ready VMs with AAP provider, new VM creation post-migration
- Identified risk scenarios: VMs in Progressing state (duplicate provision risk), EDA VMs without AAP finalizer (cleanup might be skipped), Failed VMs (unclear behavior)
- Created comprehensive migration test script (~/work/scripts/test_migration.sh) with 10 phases covering full migration lifecycle including EDA and AAP provider testing
- Optimized test script to reuse migrated VMs across provider switches and verify deprovision job creation before complete deletion

## Risks & Challenges
- Potential duplicate provision jobs if VMs are in Progressing state during migration (requires pre-migration validation)
- EDA VMs might skip deprovision if AAP finalizer is missing (need to verify finalizer exists)
- Public operator deployment details needed: CRD status, EDA webhook URLs, AAP template names for test environment

## Key Effort
Testing backward compatibility for jobs array implementation migration from public operator image to custom implementation.
