# Daily Status - 2026-02-15

## Accomplishments
- Deployed public osac-operator:latest image to vmaas-dev cluster for migration testing baseline
- Analyzed backward compatibility of jobs array implementation in [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031)
  - Validated FindLatestJobByType safety with nil/empty slices (`api/v1alpha1/job_types.go:69`)
  - Analyzed handleProvisioning migration behavior for Ready and Progressing states (`internal/controller/computeinstance_controller.go:294-332`)
  - Analyzed handleDeprovisioning for AAP and EDA providers (`internal/controller/computeinstance_controller.go:393-399`)
- Created comprehensive migration test script `~/work/scripts/test_migration.sh` (10 phases)
  - Tests VM creation with public operator (no jobs array)
  - Tests migration to custom image with jobs array support
  - Tests deprovision flow with EDA provider
  - Tests provider switch to AAP
  - Tests deprovision flow with AAP provider
  - Includes detailed polling output showing jobs array state transitions
- Identified migration risk scenarios
  - High risk: VMs in Progressing state during migration (duplicate provision attempts)
  - Medium risk: EDA VMs without AAP finalizer (cleanup might be skipped)
  - Low risk: Ready VMs (safe - version matching prevents duplicate provisioning)

## Risks & Challenges
- VMs in Progressing state during migration may trigger duplicate provision jobs (requires pre-migration state validation)
- EDA provider deprovision depends on AAP finalizer existence (need to verify public image sets this finalizer)
- Migration test execution pending - waiting for EDA webhook URLs and AAP template configuration for test environment

## Key Effort
Analyzing backward compatibility and creating comprehensive migration test plan for jobs array implementation in [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031)
