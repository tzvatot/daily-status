# Daily Status - 2026-02-15

## Accomplishments
- Rebased feature branch from upstream/main to resolve CRD incompatibility with phase states (Starting, Running vs Progressing, Ready)
- Updated code to support new phase states (Progressing→Starting, Ready→Running) in AAP provider
- Validated all changes: unit tests (69 passing), linter (0 issues), compilation, formatting, and CRD generation
- Completed comprehensive backward compatibility code analysis for jobs array migration ([MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031))
- Identified migration risk scenarios: VMs in Progressing state (duplicate provision risk), EDA VMs without AAP finalizer (cleanup issues)
- Deployed public osac-operator image to vmaas-dev cluster for migration testing
- Created comprehensive migration test script (10 phases) testing both EDA and AAP providers with jobs array tracking

## Risks & Challenges
- Migration test execution blocked pending CRD schema compatibility verification after rebase
- VMs in Progressing state during migration have duplicate provision risk
- EDA-provisioned VMs without AAP finalizer may skip deprovision webhook

## Key Effort
Testing backward compatibility for jobs array implementation when migrating from public cloudkit-operator image to new implementation with job tracking
