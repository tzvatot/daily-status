# Daily Status - 2026-02-15

## Accomplishments
- Completed code analysis of `job_types.go:69` (FindLatestJobByType) confirming nil/empty slice safety
- Analyzed backward compatibility in `computeinstance_controller.go:294-332` (handleProvisioning) and `computeinstance_controller.go:393-399` (handleDeprovisioning)
- Identified migration risk scenarios: VMs in Progressing state (duplicate provision risk), EDA VMs without AAP finalizer, failed VMs with unclear behavior
- Documented safe migration scenarios: Ready VMs with matching config versions, deprovisioning Ready VMs
- Deployed public operator image (ghcr.io/osac-project/osac-operator:latest) to vmaas-dev cluster for testing
- Created comprehensive migration test script (`~/work/scripts/test_migration.sh`) with 13 phases covering EDA and AAP provider flows
- Optimized test script to reuse migrated VMs across provider switches (VM 1 for EDA deprovision, VM 2 for AAP testing)
- Analyzed provider-specific deprovision behavior in `aap_provider.go:115-143` and `eda_provider.go:127-171`
- Work related to [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) via PR #102

## Risks & Challenges
- High risk: VMs in Progressing state during migration may trigger duplicate provision jobs
- Medium risk: EDA VMs without AAP finalizer may skip deprovision webhook
- Pending: Migration test execution needed to validate backward compatibility assumptions
- Rollback plan required: Keep public image details for quick reversion if issues found

## Key Effort
Migration testing preparation for public image → jobs array implementation with backward compatibility analysis and comprehensive test script creation.
