# Daily Status - 2026-02-15

## Accomplishments
- Analyzed backward compatibility for migrating from public cloudkit-operator image to new implementation with jobs array in PR [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102)
- Identified migration risks: VMs in Progressing state could trigger duplicate provision jobs; EDA VMs without AAP finalizer might skip deprovision cleanup
- Created comprehensive migration test script (`test_migration.sh`) covering 10 phases with EDA and AAP provider testing
- Deployed public operator image (ghcr.io/osac-project/osac-operator:latest) to vmaas-dev cluster for migration testing
- Discovered and resolved CRD incompatibility: feature branch missing "Starting" phase definition from upstream commit 4087fdb ([MGMT-22638](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22638))
- Rebased feature branch from upstream/main to incorporate phase state changes (Progressing→Starting, Ready→Running)
- Updated AAP provider code for new phase states (ComputeInstancePhaseRunning at line 172, updated comments)
- Added 6 comprehensive test cases for `isReadyForDeprovision` covering EDA provision jobs in all phases (Running, Failed, Starting, Deleting)
- Fixed all time.Now() calls to use UTC (8 instances in aap_provider_test.go) and documented UTC requirement in MEMORY.md
- Increased test coverage from 59.8% to 75.8% with all 69 tests passing
- Created PR [#106](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/106) for provider switching support with 4 commits and 207 lines added across 3 files

## Risks & Challenges
- Migration from public to custom operator poses risk of duplicate provisioning for VMs in Progressing state
- EDA-provisioned VMs without AAP finalizer may not trigger deprovision webhooks correctly during deletion
- CRD schema incompatibility required emergency rebase to align with upstream phase state changes

## Key Effort
Comprehensive backward compatibility analysis and test coverage for cloudkit-operator migration from public image to jobs array implementation, including provider switching support
