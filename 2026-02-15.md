# Daily Status - 2026-02-15

## Accomplishments
- Completed code analysis of backward compatibility for jobs array migration in [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031)
- Identified and documented migration risk scenarios (VMs in Progressing state, EDA finalizers, nil jobs array handling)
- Deployed public osac-operator image to vmaas-dev cluster for testing
- Created comprehensive migration test script (test_migration.sh) covering 10 phases with EDA and AAP provider flows
- Discovered critical CRD incompatibility between public operator (supports "Starting" phase) and feature branch (missing "Starting" phase)
- Successfully rebased feature/aap-provisioning-MGMT-23031 branch from upstream/main to resolve phase state divergence
- Updated codebase to support new phase states (Starting → Running, Progressing → Starting)
- Validated all changes: 69 unit tests passing, linter clean, CRDs generated, container builds successful

## Risks & Challenges
- Backward compatibility risk: VMs in Progressing state during migration may trigger duplicate provision jobs due to missing jobs array
- EDA VMs without AAP finalizer may skip deprovision webhook, potentially leaving cloud resources untracked
- Feature branch had diverged before commit 4087fdb which renamed phase values, requiring rebase and code updates to align with upstream

## Key Effort
Analyzed backward compatibility for jobs array migration, discovered and resolved CRD phase state incompatibility through rebase and validation for [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031)
