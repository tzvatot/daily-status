# Daily Status - 2026-02-15

## Accomplishments
- Analyzed backward compatibility for migration from public cloudkit-operator image (without jobs array) to PR #102 implementation (with jobs array)
- Identified safe migration scenarios: Ready VMs with matching config versions, deprovisioning Ready VMs, new VM creation
- Identified risk scenarios: VMs in Progressing state (duplicate provision risk), EDA VMs without AAP finalizer (cleanup might be skipped), Failed VMs (unclear behavior)
- Analyzed code safety: `FindLatestJobByType` handles nil/empty slices safely, `handleProvisioning` checks version match before triggering new provision, `handleDeprovisioning` creates new deprovision job when no job record exists
- Deployed public operator image (ghcr.io/osac-project/osac-operator:latest) to vmaas-dev cluster for migration testing
- Created comprehensive migration test script (`~/work/scripts/test_migration.sh`) with 10 phases covering: VM creation with public operator, migration to custom image with jobs array, testing both EDA and AAP providers, deprovision flows with detailed job status polling
- Work related to testing [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) changes in [PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102)

## Risks & Challenges
- VMs in Progressing state during migration may trigger duplicate provision jobs due to missing jobs array
- EDA VMs without AAP finalizer may skip deprovision webhook (cleanup might not occur)
- Failed VMs have unclear reprovision behavior after migration
- Pre-migration requirement: ensure all VMs reach Ready or terminal states before upgrading operator

## Key Effort
Validated backward compatibility and created comprehensive migration testing strategy for jobs array implementation in cloudkit-operator.
