# Daily Status - 2026-02-15

## Accomplishments
- Deployed public osac-operator image (ghcr.io/osac-project/osac-operator:latest) to vmaas-dev cluster for backward compatibility testing related to [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031)
- Analyzed FindLatestJobByType, handleProvisioning, and handleDeprovisioning functions in cloudkit-operator for backward compatibility when migrating from jobs-array-less state to jobs-array-enabled state
- Identified migration risk scenarios: VMs in Progressing state may trigger duplicate provision jobs; EDA VMs without AAP finalizer may skip cleanup
- Created comprehensive migration test script (~/work/scripts/test_migration.sh) with 10 phases covering EDA and AAP provider flows, including pre/post migration state capture and deprovision testing
- Validated safe migration scenarios: Ready VMs with matching config versions show no risk; deprovision flow creates new jobs correctly when jobs array is missing

## Risks & Challenges
- High risk: VMs in Progressing state during migration may trigger duplicate provision jobs due to missing jobs array
- Medium risk: EDA VMs without AAP finalizer may skip deprovision webhook, leaving cloud resources orphaned
- Test execution pending - migration test script created but not yet run to validate findings

## Key Effort
Backward compatibility analysis and migration testing preparation for jobs array implementation in cloudkit-operator ([MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031))
