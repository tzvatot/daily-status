# Daily Status - 2026-02-15

## Accomplishments
- Completed Phase 1 code analysis for backward compatibility when migrating from public cloudkit-operator image (without jobs array) to PR [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) implementation (with jobs array)
- Analyzed `FindLatestJobByType` safety - confirmed safe for nil/empty slices in `api/v1alpha1/job_types.go:69`
- Identified migration risk scenarios:
  - ✅ Safe: Ready VMs with matching config versions (no duplicate provisioning triggered)
  - ⚠️ High Risk: VMs in Progressing state during migration may trigger duplicate provision jobs (`internal/controller/computeinstance_controller.go:294-332`)
  - ⚠️ Medium Risk: EDA VMs without AAP finalizer may skip deprovision webhook
  - ✅ Safe: Deprovisioning Ready VMs creates new deprovision job correctly
- Analyzed provider-specific deprovision behavior:
  - AAP provider (`aap_provider.go:115-143`) safely proceeds when no provision job found
  - EDA provider (`eda_provider.go:127-171`) depends on AAP finalizer presence
- Developed comprehensive migration test execution plan with 10 phases covering EDA and AAP provider flows
- Designed test script structure (`~/work/scripts/test_migration.sh`) with polling output format, helper functions, logging workspace (`/tmp/migration-test`), and error handling

## Risks & Challenges
- **High Risk**: VMs in Progressing state during migration may trigger duplicate provision attempts due to missing jobs array
- **Medium Risk**: EDA-provisioned VMs without AAP finalizer may not trigger deprovision webhook, leaving cloud resources orphaned
- **Pending Questions**: Need public image tag, CRD deployment status, EDA webhook URLs, AAP template names, API creation method, and risk tolerance for Progressing state testing

## Key Effort
Analyzing backward compatibility and designing migration test strategy for jobs array implementation in [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) before executing migration tests
