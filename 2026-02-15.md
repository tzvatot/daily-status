# Daily Status - 2026-02-15

## Accomplishments
- Analyzed backward compatibility between public cloudkit-operator image (without jobs array) and new implementation (with jobs array) for [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031)
- Identified safe migration scenarios: Ready VMs with matching config versions, deprovisioning Ready VMs (AAP provider), and new VM creation after migration
- Identified risk scenarios: VMs in Progressing state during migration (duplicate provision risk), EDA VMs without AAP finalizer (cleanup might be skipped), and Failed VMs (unclear behavior)
- Deployed public osac-operator image (ghcr.io/osac-project/osac-operator:latest) to vmaas-dev cluster for migration testing
- Created comprehensive migration test script (~/work/scripts/test_migration.sh) with 10 phases covering full migration lifecycle, testing both EDA and AAP providers
- Analyzed FindLatestJobByType safety for nil/empty slices, handleProvisioning and handleDeprovisioning backward compatibility
- Documented migration testing approach for PR #102 (https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102)

## Risks & Challenges
- VMs in Progressing state during migration may trigger duplicate provision attempts due to missing jobs array
- EDA VMs without AAP finalizer may skip deprovision webhook, leaving cloud resources uncleaned
- Migration test execution and validation pending

## Key Effort
Migration testing and backward compatibility analysis for jobs array implementation in cloudkit-operator
