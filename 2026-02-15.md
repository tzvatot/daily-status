# Daily Status - 2026-02-15

## Accomplishments
- Analyzed backward compatibility for jobs array migration in cloudkit-operator (FindLatestJobByType, handleProvisioning, handleDeprovisioning)
- Created comprehensive migration test script (`test_migration.sh`) covering full lifecycle with EDA and AAP providers
- Deployed public osac-operator image (ghcr.io/osac-project/osac-operator:latest) to vmaas-dev for baseline testing
- Discovered and resolved CRD incompatibility issue ("Starting" phase missing in feature branch)
- Rebased feature branch from upstream/main to incorporate phase state changes (Progressing→Starting, Ready→Running per [MGMT-22638](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22638))
- Updated AAP provider code for new phase states (ComputeInstancePhaseRunning, updated comments)
- Added comprehensive test coverage for provider switch scenarios (6 new test cases for isReadyForDeprovision with EDA provision jobs)
- Fixed all time.Now() calls to use UTC for timezone consistency
- Updated ~/.claude/MEMORY.md with Go time handling requirements (always use UTC)
- Created and pushed [PR #106](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/106) - Support provider switching from EDA to AAP during deprovision
- Achieved 75.8% test coverage (up from 59.8%) with all 69 tests passing

## Risks & Challenges
- Migration risk: VMs in Progressing state during migration could trigger duplicate provision jobs
- Migration risk: EDA VMs without AAP finalizer may skip deprovision webhook, leaving cloud resources orphaned
- Mitigation: Pre-migration validation needed to ensure all VMs reach Ready/Failed state before upgrade

## Key Effort
Implemented and tested backward compatibility for jobs array migration in cloudkit-operator, enabling safe provider switching from EDA to AAP
