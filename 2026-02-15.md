# Daily Status - 2026-02-15

## Accomplishments
- Analyzed backward compatibility for jobs array migration in [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) ([PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102))
- Reviewed `FindLatestJobByType()`, `handleProvisioning()`, and `handleDeprovisioning()` code for nil/empty slice safety
- Identified migration risk scenarios: VMs in Progressing state (duplicate provision risk), EDA VMs without AAP finalizer (incomplete cleanup), Failed VMs (unclear behavior)
- Verified safe scenarios: Ready VMs with matching config versions, deprovisioning Ready VMs with AAP provider
- Deployed public osac-operator:latest image to vmaas-dev cluster (replaced custom image quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:beec750)
- Created comprehensive migration test script (`~/work/scripts/test_migration.sh`) with 10 phases covering: public operator deployment, VM creation, migration to custom image with jobs array, EDA provider testing, AAP provider switch, and deprovision flows
- Refined test script based on feedback: merged phases, removed redundant monitoring delays, optimized VM reuse between provider tests

## Risks & Challenges
- **High Risk**: VMs in Progressing state during migration may trigger duplicate provision jobs causing resource conflicts
- **Medium Risk**: EDA-provisioned VMs without AAP finalizer may skip deprovision webhook during deletion
- **Testing Blocker**: Need public cloudkit-operator image tag, EDA webhook URLs, and AAP template names for test environment

## Key Effort
Analyzed jobs array backward compatibility risks and created comprehensive 10-phase migration test script for [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031)
