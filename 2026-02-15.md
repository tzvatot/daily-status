# Daily Status - 2026-02-15

## Accomplishments
- Analyzed FindLatestJobByType for nil/empty slice safety in `api/v1alpha1/job_types.go:69`
- Analyzed handleProvisioning and handleDeprovisioning backward compatibility in `internal/controller/computeinstance_controller.go`
- Identified migration risk scenarios: duplicate provision jobs when migrating VMs in Progressing state, potential deprovision skips for EDA VMs without AAP finalizer
- Documented safe migration scenarios: Ready VMs with matching config versions, deprovisioning Ready VMs
- Deployed public operator image (ghcr.io/osac-project/osac-operator:latest) to vmaas-dev cluster
- Created comprehensive migration test script (`~/work/scripts/test_migration.sh`) with 10 phases covering public→custom operator migration, EDA provider deprovision testing, AAP provider testing, and state capture
- Testing preparation for [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) backward compatibility validation in PR #102

## Risks & Challenges
- **High Risk**: VMs in Progressing state during migration may trigger duplicate provision jobs due to missing jobs array
- **Medium Risk**: EDA VMs without AAP finalizer may skip deprovision webhook, leaving cloud resources orphaned
- **Medium Risk**: Failed VMs have unclear reprovision behavior after migration

## Key Effort
Testing backward compatibility for migrating from public cloudkit-operator image (without jobs array) to new implementation (with jobs array) for [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031)
