# Daily Status - 2026-02-15

## Accomplishments
- Deployed public operator image (ghcr.io/osac-project/osac-operator:latest) to vmaas-dev cluster for baseline testing
- Analyzed backward compatibility for jobs array migration, identifying safe scenarios (Ready VMs, deprovision flows) and risk scenarios (Progressing state VMs, EDA finalizers)
- Created comprehensive migration test script (~/work/scripts/test_migration.sh) with 10 phases testing both EDA and AAP provider flows
- Reviewed FindLatestJobByType, handleProvisioning, and handleDeprovisioning code paths for nil/empty slice safety across api/v1alpha1/job_types.go:69, internal/controller/computeinstance_controller.go:294-399, and provider implementations
- Documented migration risk assessment covering duplicate provision scenarios, finalizer dependencies, and provider-specific deprovision behavior
- Optimized test script to reuse migrated VMs across provider switches and verify deprovision job creation before deletion

## Risks & Challenges
- VMs in Progressing state during migration may trigger duplicate provision jobs (new operator sees nil jobs array, triggers new provision while old job still running)
- EDA VMs without AAP finalizer may skip deprovision webhook, leaving cloud resources orphaned
- Test execution pending - need to verify actual behavior matches code analysis

## Key Effort
Testing backward compatibility when migrating from public cloudkit-operator image (without jobs array) to new implementation ([MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031)) with comprehensive migration test script covering EDA and AAP provider flows
