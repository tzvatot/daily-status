# Daily Status - 2026-02-15

## Accomplishments
- Analyzed backward compatibility of jobs array migration in [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) ([PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/cloudkit-operator/pull/102))
  - Reviewed `FindLatestJobByType` safety for nil/empty slices (`api/v1alpha1/job_types.go:69`)
  - Analyzed `handleProvisioning` and `handleDeprovisioning` behavior with missing jobs array
  - Identified safe scenarios: Ready VMs, deprovision flow with AAP provider
  - Identified risk scenarios: VMs in Progressing state (duplicate provision risk), EDA VMs without AAP finalizer
- Deployed public osac-operator image (ghcr.io/osac-project/osac-operator:latest) to vmaas-dev cluster
- Created comprehensive migration test script (`~/work/scripts/test_migration.sh`)
  - 10 test phases covering full migration lifecycle (public → custom image with jobs array)
  - Tests both EDA and AAP provider flows
  - Detailed polling output for jobs array visibility during state transitions
  - Captures pre/post migration state for comparison

## Risks & Challenges
- **High Risk**: VMs in Progressing state during migration may trigger duplicate provision jobs due to missing jobs array
- **Medium Risk**: EDA-provisioned VMs without AAP finalizer may skip deprovision webhook, leaving cloud resources orphaned
- **Testing Pending**: Migration test script created but not yet executed - results needed to validate backward compatibility assumptions

## Key Effort
Testing backward compatibility for jobs array migration from public cloudkit-operator image to new implementation with job tracking support
