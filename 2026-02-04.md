# Daily Status - 2026-02-04

## Accomplishments
- Fixed AAP template lookup URL construction to use query parameters instead of path-based URLs ([MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880))
- Corrected API version path from `/api/controller/api/v2/` to `/api/controller/v2/` ([MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880))
- Fixed Job.ExtraVars JSON parsing to handle AAP's string-encoded format ([MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880))
- Implemented EDA event structure wrapper for template compatibility ([MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031))
- Implemented full Kubernetes resource serialization in EDA payload ([MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031))
- Successfully provisioned VM end-to-end using AAP direct provider with `osac.templates.ocp_virt_vm` template ([MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031))
- Completed full lifecycle E2E test (create → provision → ready → delete → deprovision → cleanup) ([MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031))
- Identified critical production-readiness issues: deprovision jobs fail on finalizer removal and job status not updated after completion ([MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031))

## Risks & Challenges
- **CRITICAL:** Deprovision jobs fail consistently with "spec: Required value" error when removing finalizers, though actual VM deletion succeeds
- **CRITICAL:** Job status fields not updated after AAP jobs complete, preventing proper monitoring and alerting
- **BLOCKER:** Integration not production-ready due to silent failures and inability to detect job completion states
- Template compatibility requires full resource serialization in EDA event structure, increasing complexity

## Key Effort
Completed AAP provisioning integration E2E testing, identifying critical job status tracking and deprovision failure handling issues that block production readiness.
