# Daily Status - 2026-02-09

## Accomplishments
- Completed provider abstraction refactoring (MGMT-22880) - eliminated all `switch r.ProvisioningProvider.Name()` statements from controller by implementing richer result types (`ProvisionResult`, `DeprovisionResult`) and adding `BlockDeletionOnFailure` field to CRD
- Fixed EDA deletion infinite polling bug by adding `resource` parameter to status methods, allowing EDA provider to check finalizer state for completion detection
- Fixed vmaas-dev environment - updated cloudkit-operator deployment webhook URLs from non-existent `innabox-eda-service:5000` to correct `innabox-aap-eda-api:8000` service (Revision 84)
- All 90+ unit tests passing with zero linter issues across refactored codebase
- Deployed and validated fixed operator builds: `74ced2e` (abstraction refactoring), `96423b5` (EDA deletion fix)
- Created end-to-end test script validating full ComputeInstance lifecycle including deletion completion

## Risks & Challenges
- **CRITICAL:** AAP Direct provider missing ReconciledConfigVersion update in getJobStatus() when provision succeeds - controller cannot detect spec changes vs already-reconciled state without this field populated
- Need to investigate upstream deployment manifests to fix source of incorrect webhook URLs
- Code review feedback on PR #102 still pending

## Key Effort
Achieved complete provider abstraction by eliminating controller type switches and fixing EDA deletion polling through enhanced provider interface
