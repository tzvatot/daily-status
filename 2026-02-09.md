# Daily Status - 2026-02-09

## Accomplishments
- Completed provider abstraction refactoring - eliminated all `switch r.ProvisioningProvider.Name()` statements from controller by implementing rich result types (`ProvisionResult`, `DeprovisionResult`) and adding `BlockDeletionOnFailure` field to CRD ([MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880))
- Fixed critical EDA deletion bug where deletions would loop infinitely - enhanced provider interface to pass resource object to status methods, allowing EDA provider to check finalizer removal for completion detection ([MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880))
- Resolved environment configuration issue in vmaas-dev - fixed cloudkit-operator deployment webhook URLs pointing to non-existent `innabox-eda-service:5000` service, corrected to use `innabox-aap-eda-api:8000` ([MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880))
- Internalized provider-specific logic into implementations - AAP provider handles job cancellation and sets deletion blocking policy, EDA provider checks finalizer state to determine when to trigger deprovision ([MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880))
- Achieved clean architecture with 90+ tests passing and zero linter issues - controller is now completely provider-agnostic with crash-safe deletion policies ([MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880))

## Risks & Challenges
- AAP Direct provider missing `ReconciledConfigVersion` update when provision job succeeds - without this, controller cannot detect if spec changed vs already reconciled. Currently works due to annotation set by old EDA playbook, but needs proper fix in `getJobStatus()` method.

## Key Effort
Provider abstraction refactoring to eliminate type switches and enable clean, extensible provider implementation without controller modifications.
