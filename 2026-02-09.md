# Daily Status - 2026-02-09

## Accomplishments
- Completed provider abstraction refactoring - eliminated all `switch r.ProvisioningProvider.Name()` statements from controller ([MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880))
- Added `BlockDeletionOnFailure` field to CRD to store deletion policy per provider, enabling crash-safe deletion policies
- Created rich result types (`ProvisionResult`, `DeprovisionResult`) to move provider-specific logic out of controller
- Refactored AAP provider with helper methods and internalized cancellation logic
- Refactored EDA provider with internalized finalizer check logic
- Fixed EDA deletion infinite polling bug by adding resource parameter to `GetDeprovisionStatus()` interface method
- EDA provider now detects completion by checking AAP finalizer removal (set by AAP playbook)
- Deployed and validated fixes with end-to-end test of ComputeInstance lifecycle
- Fixed EDA webhook configuration in vmaas-dev namespace (deployment pointed to non-existent service)
- Discovered and investigated 4.3x EDA performance improvement (649s → 140s provision time)
- Ruled out operator code changes as cause (tested official upstream image with same results)
- Corrected understanding of EDA service architecture (dynamic vs static services)
- All 90+ unit tests passing, zero linter issues
- Pushed commits `74ced2e` (provider abstraction) and `96423b5` (EDA deletion fix) to feature branch

## Risks & Challenges
- AAP Direct missing `ReconciledConfigVersion` update - AAP provider `getJobStatus()` must populate `ReconciledVersion` field when successful to enable proper spec change detection
- Need to investigate root cause of 4.3x EDA speedup (external infrastructure changes between Feb 8-9)

## Key Effort
Provider abstraction refactoring to eliminate type switches and achieve clean separation of provider-specific logic from controller
