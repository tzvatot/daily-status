# Daily Status - 2026-02-09

## Accomplishments
- Completed provider abstraction refactoring for [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880) - eliminated all `switch r.ProvisioningProvider.Name()` statements from controller
- Added `BlockDeletionOnFailure` field to CRD to store deletion policy set by provider during deprovision
- Created rich result types (`ProvisionResult`, `DeprovisionResult`) and updated `ProvisioningProvider` interface
- Moved provider-specific logic into AAP and EDA implementations - internalized cancellation and finalizer checks
- Fixed critical EDA deletion bug causing infinite polling by adding resource parameter to status methods
- All 90+ tests passing with zero linter issues
- Deployed and validated end-to-end: `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:96423b5`
- Commits: `74ced2e` (refactoring), `96423b5` (EDA bug fix)

## Risks & Challenges
- **CRITICAL:** AAP Direct missing ReconciledConfigVersion update - doesn't set ReconciledConfigVersion when provision job succeeds, preventing controller from detecting spec changes vs already reconciled state
- Need to address code review feedback on PR #102

## Key Effort
Achieved complete provider abstraction by eliminating type switches and moving provider-specific logic into implementations while maintaining clean separation of concerns.
