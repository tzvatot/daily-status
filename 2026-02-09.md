# Daily Status - 2026-02-09

## Accomplishments
- Completed provider abstraction refactoring for [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880): eliminated all `switch r.ProvisioningProvider.Name()` statements from controller by implementing richer result types (`ProvisionResult`, `DeprovisionResult`) and adding `BlockDeletionOnFailure` field to CRD
- Fixed critical EDA deletion infinite polling bug by adding resource parameter to status methods, allowing EDA provider to check AAP finalizer state for completion detection
- Successfully deployed and validated refactored operator (commits `74ced2e` and `96423b5`) with end-to-end lifecycle testing
- All 90+ unit tests passing, zero linter issues, clean provider-agnostic controller architecture achieved

## Risks & Challenges
- **CRITICAL:** AAP Direct missing ReconciledConfigVersion update - when provision jobs succeed, the ReconciledVersion field is not populated, preventing controller from detecting spec changes vs already-reconciled state (currently works due to workaround reading EDA playbook annotations)

## Key Effort
Completed provider abstraction refactoring to eliminate controller type switches and fixed EDA deletion polling bug while maintaining clean architectural separation.
