# Daily Status - 2026-02-09

## Accomplishments
- Completed provider abstraction refactoring - eliminated all provider type switches from controller (commits `74ced2e`, `96423b5`)
- Fixed [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) EDA deletion infinite polling bug by adding resource parameter to status methods
- Fixed EDA webhook configuration in vmaas-dev environment (corrected `innabox-eda-service:5000` service URLs)
- Fixed job state mapping inconsistencies - added `JobStateWaiting` and `JobStateUnknown`, corrected AAP status mappings (commits `47428b4`, `fad351a`)
- Investigated EDA performance improvement - discovered genuine 4.3x speedup (649s → 135s) caused by external infrastructure changes
- Created test automation scripts (`create_ci.sh`, `delete_ci.sh`) for ComputeInstance lifecycle validation
- All 90+ unit tests passing with zero linter issues across refactored codebase

## Risks & Challenges
- Discovered bug: concurrent provision and deprovision jobs running simultaneously - needs investigation of race conditions in job cancellation logic
- Test scripts need provider-aware logic (AAP expects state transitions, EDA doesn't support polling)
- [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880) AAP Direct missing ReconciledConfigVersion update - blocks proper spec change detection

## Key Effort
Completed [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) provider abstraction refactoring and fixed multiple critical bugs in job state handling and EDA deletion flow
