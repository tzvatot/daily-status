# Daily Status - 2026-02-09

## Accomplishments
- Completed provider abstraction refactoring for [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880) - eliminated all provider type switches from controller, moved provider-specific logic into provider implementations, added BlockDeletionOnFailure field to CRD, created rich result types (ProvisionResult, DeprovisionResult)
- Fixed EDA deletion infinite polling bug - added resource parameter to status methods to allow EDA provider to check finalizer for completion detection
- All 90+ tests passing with zero linter issues
- Deployed and validated refactored operator (`quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:96423b5`) with end-to-end testing
- Created commits: `74ced2e` (provider abstraction), `96423b5` (EDA deletion fix)

## Risks & Challenges
- **CRITICAL:** AAP Direct missing ReconciledConfigVersion update - AAP Direct doesn't set ReconciledConfigVersion when provision job succeeds, which prevents controller from detecting spec changes vs already reconciled state. Fix needed in `internal/provisioning/aap_provider.go:178` to populate ReconciledVersion field when State=Succeeded

## Key Effort
Refactored controller to be completely provider-agnostic by eliminating type switches and implementing provider-specific deletion policies through rich result types and CRD changes
