# Daily Status - 2026-02-09

## Accomplishments
- Completed provider abstraction refactoring to eliminate all `switch r.ProvisioningProvider.Name()` type checks from controller ([MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880))
- Added `BlockDeletionOnFailure` field to CRD for crash-safe deletion policies
- Created rich result types (`ProvisionResult`, `DeprovisionResult`) with `DeprovisionAction` enum
- Internalized provider-specific logic: AAP cancellation and EDA finalizer checks now in provider implementations
- Fixed critical EDA deletion infinite polling bug by adding resource parameter to status methods
- Validated end-to-end ComputeInstance lifecycle with test script (`019c41fe-449f-7c8a-baf3-b4bfa59f6cd2`)
- Fixed vmaas-dev environment: corrected EDA webhook URLs from non-existent `innabox-eda-service:5000` to `innabox-aap-eda-api:8000`
- Improved latency experiment script provider verification to check environment variables directly
- All 90+ unit tests passing, zero linter issues
- Deployed refactored operator builds: `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:74ced2e` and `quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:96423b5`

## Risks & Challenges
- **CRITICAL:** AAP Direct missing ReconciledConfigVersion update - provider doesn't set ReconciledConfigVersion when provision succeeds, preventing proper spec change detection (workaround exists via annotation reading)
- Need to investigate upstream deployment manifests to fix source of incorrect EDA webhook URLs
- Need to update PR #102 with refactoring commits and address code review feedback

## Key Effort
Eliminated all provider type switching from controller through clean abstraction with rich result types and provider-owned policy decisions
