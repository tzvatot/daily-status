# Daily Status - 2026-02-09

## Accomplishments
- Completed provider abstraction refactoring to eliminate type switches from controller code - implemented richer result types (ProvisionResult, DeprovisionResult) and moved provider-specific logic into provider implementations ([MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031))
- Added BlockDeletionOnFailure field to CRD JobStatus for crash-safe deletion policies ([MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880))
- Fixed EDA deletion infinite polling bug by adding resource parameter to GetDeprovisionStatus interface method, allowing EDA provider to check finalizer state for completion detection
- Fixed job state mapping inconsistencies - added JobStateWaiting and JobStateUnknown states, corrected AAP status mappings (pending/waiting/running were all incorrectly mapped to Running)
- Fixed vmaas-dev environment EDA webhook configuration - corrected service URLs from non-existent innabox-eda-service to correct innabox-aap-eda-api endpoints
- Investigated and documented EDA performance improvement (649s → 140s, 4.3x faster) - ruled out operator code changes, identified external infrastructure improvements as cause
- Built and deployed operator images (74ced2e, 96423b5, 47428b4) with all changes validated in cluster
- Created test automation scripts (create_ci.sh, delete_ci.sh, monitor_experiment.sh) for lifecycle testing
- All 90+ unit tests passing with zero linter issues

## Risks & Challenges
- Discovered bug during testing: concurrent provision and deprovision jobs running simultaneously (provision job 7265 not cancelled before deprovision job 7267 started) - race condition investigation in progress
- Critical issue outstanding: AAP Direct provider not setting ReconciledConfigVersion when provision succeeds, preventing detection of spec changes vs already-reconciled state
- Test scripts need provider-aware logic updates (AAP expects state transitions, EDA doesn't support polling)

## Key Effort
Completed comprehensive provider abstraction refactoring with crash-safe deletion policies and fixed multiple bugs in job state handling and EDA workflows
