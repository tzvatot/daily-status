# Daily Status - 2026-02-09

## Accomplishments
- Completed provider abstraction refactoring for [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880) - eliminated all provider type switches from controller
- Moved provider-specific logic into provider implementations with rich result types (ProvisionResult, DeprovisionResult)
- Added BlockDeletionOnFailure field to CRD for crash-safe deletion policies
- Updated AAP and EDA provider implementations with internalized decision logic
- Achieved 90+ tests passing with zero linter issues across controller, AAP, and EDA components
- Regenerated CRDs and verified all quality checks (formatting, linting, unit tests)

## Risks & Challenges
- **CRITICAL:** AAP Direct missing ReconciledConfigVersion update - provider doesn't set ReconciledConfigVersion when provision job succeeds, preventing detection of spec changes. Currently works due to annotation workaround from old EDA playbook. Fix needed in internal/provisioning/aap_provider.go:178 getJobStatus() method.
- Pending deployment and testing of provider abstraction refactoring in cluster
- PR #102 needs updating with refactoring commits and code review feedback needs to be addressed

## Key Effort
Achieved clean provider abstraction by eliminating controller type switches and implementing provider-specific workflows through rich result types and CRD fields.
