# Daily Status - 2026-02-09

## Accomplishments
- Completed provider abstraction refactoring - eliminated all `switch r.ProvisioningProvider.Name()` statements from controller by introducing rich result types (`ProvisionResult`, `DeprovisionResult`) and adding `BlockDeletionOnFailure` field to CRD ([MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880))
- Fixed EDA deletion infinite polling bug by adding `resource client.Object` parameter to status methods, allowing EDA provider to detect completion via finalizer removal ([MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880))
- Deployed and validated refactored operator (`quay.io/etabak/cloudkit-operator:96423b5`) with successful end-to-end ComputeInstance lifecycle test
- Fixed vmaas-dev environment EDA webhook configuration - corrected URLs from non-existent `innabox-eda-service:5000` to `innabox-aap-eda-api:8000`, then reverted after discovering dynamic service pattern
- Investigated and documented 4.3x EDA performance improvement (649s → 135-144s provision time) - ruled out operator code changes as cause by testing official upstream image
- All 90+ unit tests passing, zero linter issues, clean architecture with complete provider abstraction

## Risks & Challenges
- AAP Direct missing ReconciledConfigVersion update when provision job succeeds - controller cannot detect if spec changed vs already reconciled without this critical field

## Key Effort
Achieving complete provider abstraction by eliminating all provider type switching from controller through richer result types and CRD changes
