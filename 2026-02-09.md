# Daily Status - 2026-02-09

## Accomplishments
- Completed provider abstraction refactoring for [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880) - eliminated all `switch r.ProvisioningProvider.Name()` statements from controller
- Added `BlockDeletionOnFailure` field to JobStatus CRD to store deletion policies set by providers
- Created rich result types (`ProvisionResult`, `DeprovisionResult`) to remove provider type checking
- Updated AAP and EDA provider implementations to internalize provider-specific logic
- Fixed critical EDA deletion infinite polling bug by adding resource parameter to status methods
- Deployed and validated refactored operator with end-to-end testing
- All 90+ unit tests passing, zero linter issues
- Created commits: `74ced2e` (provider abstraction), `96423b5` (EDA deletion fix)

## Risks & Challenges
- **CRITICAL:** AAP Direct missing ReconciledConfigVersion update - AAP provider doesn't set ReconciledConfigVersion when provision job succeeds, preventing detection of spec changes vs already reconciled state

## Key Effort
Completed provider abstraction refactoring to make controller completely provider-agnostic and fixed EDA deletion infinite polling bug.
