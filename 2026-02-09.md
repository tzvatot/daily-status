# Daily Status - 2026-02-09

## Accomplishments
- Completed provider abstraction refactoring for [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880) - eliminated all provider type switches from controller, moved provider-specific logic into provider implementations, added BlockDeletionOnFailure field to CRD, created rich result types (ProvisionResult, DeprovisionResult), all 90+ tests passing with zero linter issues
- Fixed EDA deletion infinite polling bug - added resource parameter to GetDeprovisionStatus() allowing EDA provider to check AAP finalizer for completion detection, deployed and validated with end-to-end test
- Fixed vmaas-dev environment EDA webhook configuration - corrected deployment URLs from non-existent `innabox-eda-service:5000` to correct `innabox-aap-eda-api:8000`, improved experiment script provider verification, cleaned up stuck VMs
- Investigated and documented EDA performance improvement - verified genuine 4.3x speedup (649s → ~140s provision time) using controlled testing with both custom and official upstream operator images, ruled out operator code changes as cause, identified external infrastructure improvements as likely cause
- Discovered critical concurrent provision/deprovision jobs bug in ComputeInstance `vm-jgkx2` - provision job still running during deletion phase while deprovision job started prematurely

## Risks & Challenges
- **CRITICAL:** Concurrent provision and deprovision jobs bug discovered - provision job (7265) still running when deprovision job (7267) started, indicates race condition or failed cancellation logic, potential for resource conflicts and orphaned resources in AAP
- **CRITICAL:** AAP Direct missing ReconciledConfigVersion update - AAP Direct doesn't set ReconciledConfigVersion when provision succeeds, preventing controller from detecting spec changes vs already reconciled state
- Outstanding mystery on EDA 4.3x speedup cause - need to investigate what changed in AAP/EDA infrastructure between Feb 8-9

## Key Effort
Eliminating provider type switching through richer result types and CRD-based deletion policies to achieve clean provider abstraction while maintaining crash-safe deletion behavior.
