# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Created comprehensive test coverage plan for AAP Direct provider (21 scenarios across 3 priority levels) and validated baseline E2E tests (3/3 passing) for [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031)
- Created pull request [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider implementation (24 commits implementing job lifecycle management, template caching, and optimistic concurrency handling) related to [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880)
- Implemented CRD refactoring to convert flat job status fields to nested JobStatus structure (~70 code changes across 6 files), deployed to vmaas-dev cluster, and validated with E2E tests (2/2 passing)
- Fixed daily status automation: resolved GitHub Pages publishing, added comprehensive logging and desktop notifications, created systemd timer service (15-minute intervals) - site now live at https://tzvatot.github.io/daily-status/
- Discovered and fixed critical EDA provider deletion bug causing infinite loop - implemented provider-specific deletion logic with ShouldProceedWithDeprovision interface and typed NotFoundError for AAP 404 handling (commits 74af320, b4b15d3)
- Completed latency comparison experiment: AAP Direct vs EDA - AAP Direct provides 4.4x faster provisioning (147s vs 649s), 3x faster overall lifecycle (238s vs 725s), with consistent results across 3 parallel tests per provider
- Improved code quality: replaced deprecated interface{} with 'any' (39 replacements), added missing unit tests for AAP client and provider - coverage improvements AAP 73.9% → 87.0%, Provisioning 70.4% → 74.1%
- Conducted technical deep dive on optimistic concurrency control using Kubernetes resourceVersion to prevent duplicate AAP job triggers during concurrent reconcile loops

## Risks & Challenges
**CRITICAL:** AAP Direct provider missing ReconciledConfigVersion update in getJobStatus() when provision job succeeds - without this, controller cannot detect spec changes vs already-reconciled state. Currently works only due to annotation set by old EDA playbook. Fix needed in internal/provisioning/aap_provider.go:178 to populate ReconciledVersion field from job output when State=Succeeded.

## Key Effort
AAP Direct provider implementation, testing, CRD refactoring, bug fixes, and performance validation through latency comparison experiments
