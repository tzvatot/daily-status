# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Created pull request [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider implementation with job lifecycle management
- Validated baseline E2E tests for AAP Direct provider (3/3 passing: creation/deletion, restart, delete-during-provisioning)
- Implemented CRD refactoring to convert flat job status fields to nested JobStatus structure (~70 code changes across 6 files)
- Deployed nested job status refactoring to vmaas-dev cluster and validated with E2E tests (2/2 passing)
- Fixed critical bug causing EDA provider deletions to hang indefinitely by implementing provider-specific deletion logic
- Completed latency comparison experiment: AAP Direct 4.4x faster provisioning (147s vs 649s), 3x faster overall lifecycle (238s vs 725s)
- Improved code coverage: AAP package 73.9% → 87.0%, Provisioning package 70.4% → 74.1% by adding missing unit tests
- Modernized codebase by replacing deprecated interface{} with 'any' type (39 replacements)
- Added typed error handling for HTTP 404 and 405 responses in AAP client
- Fixed daily status automation with systemd timer (15-minute intervals), logging, and desktop notifications
- Re-enabled GitHub Pages publishing for daily-status repository at https://tzvatot.github.io/daily-status/
- Deep dive into fulfillment-service hub architecture and multi-cluster orchestration patterns
- Work tracked in [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) and [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880)

## Risks & Challenges
- **Critical Issue Identified:** AAP Direct provider missing ReconciledConfigVersion update when provision job succeeds - must populate ReconciledVersion field in ProvisionStatus to enable spec change detection
- Provider abstraction refactoring in progress - eliminating switch statements from controller by using richer result types and CRD changes

## Key Effort
Implemented and deployed AAP Direct provider with nested job status structure, achieving 4.4x faster provisioning than EDA while fixing critical deletion bug.
