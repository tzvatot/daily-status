# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Analyzed AAP Direct provider implementation and identified 21 test scenarios across 3 priority levels
- Executed baseline E2E tests: all 3 tests passing (basic creation/deletion, restart functionality, delete during provisioning)
- Created [PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider implementation (24 commits, ready for review)
- Fixed daily-status repository GitHub Pages publishing and made site live at https://tzvatot.github.io/daily-status/
- Enhanced publishing script with comprehensive logging, error handling, and desktop notifications
- Created systemd user service and timer for automated publishing every 15 minutes
- Explored fulfillment-service hub architecture and multi-cluster orchestration patterns
- Implemented CRD refactoring: converted flat job status fields to nested JobStatus structure (~70 code changes across 6 files)
- Updated and validated all unit tests (60 tests) and integration tests for nested structure
- Deployed refactored code to vmaas-dev cluster and validated with E2E tests (2/2 passing)
- Updated PR #102 with nested job status documentation and YAML examples
- Updated osac-test-infra playbooks for nested field access via jsonpath (commit `eaf7473`)
- Modernized AAP code: replaced 39 instances of `interface{}` with `any` type alias
- Expanded test coverage: AAP client 73.9% → 87.0% (+13.1%), provisioning 70.4% → 74.1% (+3.7%)
- Documented optimistic concurrency mechanism preventing duplicate AAP job triggers
- Related: [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031), [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880)
