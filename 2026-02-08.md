# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Created pull request [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider implementation with 24 commits implementing job lifecycle management, automatic template detection, and optimistic concurrency handling
- Validated baseline E2E tests - all 3 passing (basic creation/deletion, restart functionality, delete during provisioning)
- Implemented CRD refactoring converting flat job status fields to nested JobStatus structure (~70 code changes across 6 files)
- Deployed refactored operator to vmaas-dev cluster and validated with E2E tests (2/2 passing)
- Improved AAP code coverage: client package 73.9% → 87.0% (+13.1%), provisioning package 70.4% → 74.1% (+3.7%)
- Fixed daily status automation - GitHub Pages publishing, systemd timer (15-minute intervals), logging and desktop notifications
- Modernized Go code replacing deprecated `interface{}` with `any` (39 replacements across 4 files)
- Established AAP Direct latency baseline: average provision=171s, deprovision=104s, total=275s (3 runs)
- Discovered and documented critical EDA provider deletion bug causing infinite loop when deleting Ready instances
- Identified missing ReconciledConfigVersion update in AAP Direct provider's successful provision flow

## Risks & Challenges
- **CRITICAL:** EDA provider deletion bug blocks all deprovisioning for EDA-created instances (stuck in "Deleting" phase indefinitely due to job status polling incompatibility)
- **CRITICAL:** AAP Direct missing ReconciledConfigVersion update when provision succeeds - controller cannot detect spec changes vs already-reconciled state
- Latency comparison experiment blocked until EDA deletion bug is resolved

## Key Effort
Implementing and validating nested job status structure refactoring with comprehensive E2E testing and code quality improvements
