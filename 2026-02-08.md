# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Created pull request for AAP Direct provider implementation ([#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102)) with job lifecycle management, automatic template detection, and optimistic concurrency handling for [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) and [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880)
- Validated baseline E2E tests for AAP Direct provider (3/3 passing: basic creation/deletion, restart functionality, delete during provisioning)
- Identified 21 test scenarios across 3 priority levels for comprehensive coverage
- Implemented CRD refactoring to convert flat job status fields to nested JobStatus structure (~70 code changes, 6 files modified)
- Deployed refactored code to vmaas-dev cluster and validated with E2E tests (2/2 passing)
- Fixed daily status automation: GitHub Pages publishing restored, Claude CLI integration debugged, systemd timer service enabled (15-minute intervals)
- Added comprehensive logging (`/tmp/daily-status-publish.log`) and desktop notifications for automated publishing failures
- Updated PR #102 with nested job status structure documentation and benefits
- Pushed cloudkit-operator refactoring branch (`feature/aap-provisioning-MGMT-23031`, commit `05348bf`)
- Updated osac-test-infra E2E tests for nested field access using jsonpath (branch `feature/compute-instance-delete-during-provision-test`, commit `eaf7473`)
- Explored hub concept in fulfillment-service architecture (multi-cluster orchestration patterns)
- Achieved zero linter issues and 40.5% controller test coverage

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Implemented and deployed nested job status structure refactoring with complete E2E validation for AAP provisioning abstraction.
