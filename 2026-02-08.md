# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Created pull request [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider with 24 commits implementing job lifecycle management and automatic template detection
- Validated baseline E2E tests (3/3 passing) for AAP Direct provider implementation in [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031)
- Implemented CRD refactoring converting flat job status fields to nested JobStatus structure (~70 code changes across 6 files)
- Deployed refactored operator to vmaas-dev cluster and validated with E2E tests (2/2 passing)
- Fixed daily status automation: GitHub Pages publishing, systemd timer (15-min intervals), logging and desktop notifications
- Modernized AAP code by replacing `interface{}` with `any` (39 replacements) and expanded unit test coverage
- Improved test coverage: AAP client 73.9% → 87.0% (+13.1%), Provisioning 70.4% → 74.1% (+3.7%)
- Analyzed optimistic concurrency implementation preventing duplicate AAP job triggers during reconcile races
- Explored hub architecture in fulfillment-service for multi-cluster orchestration patterns
- Identified 21 test scenarios across 3 priority levels for comprehensive AAP Direct provider testing
- Updated osac-test-infra playbook to work with nested job status structure using jsonpath queries

## Risks & Challenges
