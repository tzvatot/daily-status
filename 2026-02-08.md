# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Test coverage planning: Identified 21 test scenarios across 3 priority levels for AAP Direct provider
- Baseline E2E validation: All 3 existing tests passing (creation/deletion, restart, delete-during-provisioning)
- Created pull request [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider (24 commits, ready for review)
- Related to [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) and [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880)
- CRD refactoring: Converted flat job status fields to nested JobStatus structure (~70 code changes across 6 files)
- Deployed refactored operator to vmaas-dev cluster and validated with E2E tests (2/2 passing)
- Daily status automation: Implemented systemd timer (15-min intervals), added logging, fixed Claude CLI integration, enabled GitHub Pages publishing
- Code quality improvements: Replaced interface{} with 'any' (39 replacements), expanded test coverage (AAP 73.9% → 87.0%, Provisioning 70.4% → 74.1%)
- Architecture learning: Deep dive into fulfillment-service hub concept and multi-cluster orchestration patterns
- Updated PR [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) with nested job status documentation
- Pushed cloudkit-operator and osac-test-infra updates to forks

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Implemented and validated nested job status structure refactoring for ComputeInstance CRD with full E2E testing.
