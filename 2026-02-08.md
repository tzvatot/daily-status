# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Completed comprehensive test coverage planning for AAP Direct provider implementation (21 scenarios across 3 priority levels documented)
- Successfully validated baseline E2E tests (3/3 passing: basic creation/deletion, restart functionality, delete during provisioning)
- Created pull request [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider with 24 commits implementing job lifecycle management
- Implemented CRD refactoring to convert flat job status fields to nested JobStatus structure (~70 code changes across 6 files)
- Deployed refactored operator to vmaas-dev and validated with E2E tests (2/2 passing with nested structure)
- Fixed daily status automation with systemd timer (15-minute intervals), GitHub Pages publishing, comprehensive logging, and desktop notifications
- Completed deep dive into hub concept and fulfillment-service multi-cluster orchestration architecture
- Modernized AAP codebase by replacing interface{} with 'any' (39 replacements) and added missing unit tests
- Improved test coverage: AAP client 73.9% → 87.0% (+13.1%), Provisioning 70.4% → 74.1% (+3.7%)
- Fixed critical EDA provider deletion infinite loop bug [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) with provider-specific deletion logic and 404 error handling
- Deployed bug fixes to vmaas-dev (commits 74af320, b4b15d3) and verified stuck VMs successfully deleted
- Completed latency comparison experiment between AAP Direct and EDA providers (3 parallel tests each)
- Documented performance findings: AAP Direct 4.4x faster provisioning (147s vs 649s), 3x faster overall lifecycle (238s vs 725s) compared to EDA

## Risks & Challenges
**CRITICAL:** AAP Direct provider missing ReconciledConfigVersion update mechanism - controller cannot detect spec changes vs already-reconciled state without this field being set when provision job succeeds. Fix required in `internal/provisioning/aap_provider.go:178` to populate ReconciledVersion when job state is Succeeded.

## Key Effort
Implementing and deploying AAP Direct provider with nested job status structure, fixing EDA deletion bug, and quantifying 4.4x provisioning performance improvement over EDA through latency experiments.
