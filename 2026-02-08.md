# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Created pull request [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider implementation with 24 commits ([MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031), [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880))
- Validated baseline E2E tests: all 3 tests passing (basic creation/deletion, restart functionality, delete during provisioning)
- Analyzed and documented 21 test scenarios across 3 priority levels for comprehensive coverage
- Implemented CRD refactoring: converted flat job status fields to nested JobStatus structure (~70 code changes across 6 files)
- Deployed refactored operator to vmaas-dev cluster and validated with E2E tests (2/2 passing)
- Fixed daily status automation: added systemd timer (15-minute intervals), logging, notifications, and GitHub Pages publishing
- Improved code quality: replaced `interface{}` with `any` (39 replacements), added missing unit tests
- Increased test coverage: AAP client 73.9% → 87.0% (+13.1%), provisioning 70.4% → 74.1% (+3.7%)
- Updated PR #102 with nested job status documentation and YAML examples
- Explored fulfillment-service hub architecture and multi-cluster orchestration patterns
- Documented optimistic concurrency mechanism for preventing duplicate AAP job triggers
