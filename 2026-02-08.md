# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Completed comprehensive test coverage analysis for AAP Direct provider implementation - identified 21 test scenarios across 3 priority levels (high/medium/lower priority)
- Analyzed "delete during pending" race condition and documented recommendation to skip Pending-state E2E test (code path identical to Running state)
- Validated AAP Direct provider baseline - all 3 E2E tests passing (basic creation/deletion, restart functionality, delete during provisioning)
- Confirmed AAP Direct provider stability: job cancellation working correctly, retry mechanism preventing duplicate jobs, clean resource cleanup
- Created pull request [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider implementation (24 commits) in osac-project/osac-operator
- PR implements AAP Direct provider with REST API integration, job lifecycle management, automatic template detection, provider-aware deletion logic, and optimistic concurrency handling
- PR addresses [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) (AAP provisioning abstraction) and [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880) (AAP provisioning integration)

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
AAP Direct provider implementation and E2E test validation for pull request creation
