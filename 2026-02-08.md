# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Analyzed AAP Direct provider implementation and identified 21 test scenarios across 3 priority levels
- Validated baseline E2E tests - all 3 tests passing (creation/deletion, restart functionality, delete during provisioning)
- Created [PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider implementation (24 commits) related to [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) and [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880)
- Fixed daily-status repository GitHub Pages publishing at https://tzvatot.github.io/daily-status/
- Enhanced publishing script with comprehensive logging, error handling, and desktop notifications
- Created systemd timer service for automated daily status publishing (runs every 15 minutes)
- Explored hub architecture concept in cloudkit-operator and fulfillment-service
- Implemented CRD refactoring to convert flat job status fields to nested JobStatus structure (~70 code changes across 6 files)
- Updated all unit tests (58 controller tests) and integration tests to work with nested structure
- Regenerated CRD manifests with new nested schema validation
- Deployed refactored code to vmaas-dev cluster and validated with E2E tests (2/2 passing)
- Updated [PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) with nested job status documentation and examples
- Updated E2E test playbooks in osac-test-infra to use jsonpath with nested field access
- Pushed all changes to forks: cloudkit-operator (commit 05348bf) and osac-test-infra (commit eaf7473)

## Risks & Challenges
