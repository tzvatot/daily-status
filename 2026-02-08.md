# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Created [pull request #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider implementation with 24 commits implementing job lifecycle management, automatic template detection, and provider-aware deletion logic (related to [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) and [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880))
- Validated baseline E2E tests - all 3 tests passing (basic creation/deletion, restart functionality, delete during provisioning)
- Analyzed and documented 21 comprehensive test scenarios across 3 priority levels for AAP Direct provider
- Implemented CRD refactoring to convert flat job status fields to nested JobStatus structure (~70 code changes across 6 files)
- Successfully deployed refactored code to vmaas-dev cluster and validated with E2E tests (2/2 passing)
- Fixed daily status automation - GitHub Pages publishing re-enabled, systemd timer configured (15-minute intervals), logging and desktop notifications implemented
- Modernized Go codebase by replacing deprecated `interface{}` with `any` type alias (39 replacements across 4 files)
- Expanded test coverage for AAP client and provider - AAP package improved from 73.9% to 87.0% (+13.1%), provisioning package from 70.4% to 74.1% (+3.7%)
- Updated osac-test-infra test playbooks to work with nested job status structure using jsonpath queries
- Explored fulfillment-service architecture and learned hub concept for multi-cluster orchestration
- Documented optimistic concurrency implementation preventing duplicate AAP job triggers during concurrent reconcile loops

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Implemented and validated nested job status structure refactoring for AAP Direct provider with full test coverage and successful cluster deployment
