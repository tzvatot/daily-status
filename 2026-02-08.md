# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Created pull request [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider implementation with 24 commits covering job lifecycle management, template detection, and provider-aware deletion logic
- Validated all baseline E2E tests passing (3/3): basic creation/deletion, restart functionality, and delete-during-provisioning scenarios
- Implemented CRD refactoring converting flat job status fields to nested JobStatus structure across 6 files (~70 code changes)
- Deployed refactored operator to vmaas-dev cluster and validated with 2 E2E tests, confirming nested structure working correctly
- Fixed daily status automation: re-enabled GitHub Pages publishing, added comprehensive logging to `/tmp/daily-status-publish.log`, implemented error notifications, and set up systemd timer running every 15 minutes
- Improved code quality: replaced deprecated `interface{}` with `any` (39 replacements), added missing unit tests for AAP client and provider
- Increased test coverage: AAP package from 73.9% to 87.0% (+13.1%), provisioning package from 70.4% to 74.1% (+3.7%)
- Analyzed comprehensive test scenarios identifying 21 test cases across 3 priority levels for AAP Direct provider
- Explored hub concept in fulfillment-service architecture understanding multi-cluster orchestration patterns
- Documented optimistic concurrency control mechanism preventing duplicate AAP job triggers during concurrent reconcile loops
- Designed and initiated latency comparison experiment between AAP Direct and EDA providers, established AAP Direct baseline (average: provision 171s, deprovision 104s)
- Discovered critical bug in EDA provider deletion flow: infinite loop in `ensureProvisionJobTerminated()` blocking all EDA deletions when phase=Ready but job state remains "Running"

## Risks & Challenges
- **CRITICAL BUG:** EDA provider deletion infinite loop blocks all deprovisioning for EDA-created ComputeInstances - blocks latency comparison experiment completion
- Latency comparison experiment incomplete due to EDA deletion bug (3 VMs stuck in "Deleting" phase indefinitely)

## Key Effort
Implementing and validating nested job status CRD refactoring with successful deployment to cluster, while discovering and documenting critical EDA provider deletion bug
