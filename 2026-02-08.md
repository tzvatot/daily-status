# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Created pull request [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider implementation with 24 commits covering job lifecycle management, template caching, and optimistic concurrency handling
- Validated baseline E2E tests (3/3 passing): basic creation/deletion, restart functionality, and delete-during-provisioning
- Analyzed and documented 21 test scenarios across 3 priority levels for comprehensive AAP Direct provider coverage
- Implemented CRD refactoring to convert flat job status fields to nested JobStatus structure (~70 code changes across 6 files)
- Deployed refactored operator to vmaas-dev cluster and validated with E2E tests (2/2 passing)
- Fixed daily status automation: GitHub Pages publishing, systemd timer (15-minute intervals), logging to `/tmp/daily-status-publish.log`, and desktop failure notifications
- Fixed inline Jira link formatting in daily status reports (tickets now clickable in Accomplishments section)
- Modernized AAP codebase by replacing `interface{}` with `any` (39 replacements across 4 files)
- Expanded test coverage: AAP client 73.9% → 87.0% (+13.1%), provisioning 70.4% → 74.1% (+3.7%)
- Added missing unit tests for CanCancelJob, CancelJob, CancelProvision, and Name() methods (all 60 tests passing)
- Explored hub concept in fulfillment-service architecture (multi-cluster orchestration patterns)
- Deep dive into optimistic concurrency implementation preventing duplicate job triggers
- Updated osac-test-infra playbook `test_compute_instance_delete_during_provision.yml` for nested job status field access

## Risks & Challenges
None

## Key Effort
Implementing and validating nested job status structure refactoring in AAP Direct provider with full E2E deployment testing
