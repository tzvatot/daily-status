# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Analyzed AAP Direct provider implementation and documented 21 test scenarios across 3 priority levels
- Validated baseline E2E tests - all 3 tests passing (creation/deletion, restart functionality, delete during provisioning)
- Created pull request [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider with 24 commits implementing job lifecycle management
- Fixed daily-status repository GitHub Pages publishing and made site live at https://tzvatot.github.io/daily-status/
- Enhanced publishing script with comprehensive logging, error handling, and desktop notifications
- Created systemd user service and timer for automatic daily status publishing (runs every 15 minutes)
- Explored hub concept in cloudkit-operator and fulfillment-service architecture (multi-cluster orchestration patterns)
- Implemented CRD refactoring to convert flat job status fields to nested JobStatus structure (~70 code changes across 6 files)
- Updated all unit tests (58 controller tests) and integration tests to work with nested structure
- Deployed refactored code to vmaas-dev cluster and validated with E2E tests (2/2 passing)
- Updated PR [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) with nested job status documentation and YAML examples
- Updated osac-test-infra test playbook to use jsonpath with nested field access (commit `eaf7473`)
- Related work: [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031), [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880)
