# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Test coverage analysis completed identifying 21 scenarios across 3 priority levels for AAP Direct provider
- Baseline E2E tests validated (3/3 passing: basic creation/deletion, restart functionality, delete during provisioning)
- Pull request created ([#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102)) for [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) AAP Direct provider implementation with 24 commits
- CRD refactoring implemented converting flat job status fields to nested JobStatus structure (~70 code changes across 6 files)
- Deployed refactored operator to vmaas-dev cluster and validated with E2E tests (2/2 passing)
- Daily status automation improved with systemd timer (15-minute intervals), logging, and desktop notifications
- GitHub Pages publishing fixed for daily-status repository (now live at https://tzvatot.github.io/daily-status/)
- Code quality improvements: replaced deprecated interface{} with 'any' (39 replacements), added missing unit tests
- Test coverage increased: AAP client 73.9% → 87.0% (+13.1%), provisioning 70.4% → 74.1% (+3.7%)
- Hub concept architecture exploration completed (fulfillment-service multi-cluster orchestration patterns)
- AAP Direct latency baseline established (3 runs: avg provision=171s, deprovision=104s, total=275s)
- Critical bug discovered and documented in EDA provider deletion flow (infinite loop in ensureProvisionJobTerminated)
- Technical deep dive completed on optimistic concurrency mechanism preventing duplicate AAP job triggers

## Risks & Challenges
- **CRITICAL BUG:** EDA provider deletion stuck in infinite loop - ComputeInstances remain in "Deleting" phase indefinitely because ensureProvisionJobTerminated assumes all providers support job status polling, but EDA always returns state=Running
- **MISSING FEATURE:** AAP Direct doesn't set ReconciledConfigVersion when provision job succeeds - currently works due to workaround reading EDA playbook annotation, but proper fix needed in getJobStatus() to populate ReconciledVersion field
- Latency comparison experiment blocked by EDA deletion bug (3 VMs stuck in Deleting phase)

## Key Effort
AAP Direct provider implementation completed with nested job status refactoring, comprehensive testing, and code quality improvements; discovered critical EDA deletion bug blocking latency experiments
