# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Analyzed AAP Direct provider implementation and identified 21 test scenarios across 3 priority levels
- Validated baseline E2E tests - all 3 passing (basic creation/deletion, restart functionality, delete during provisioning)
- Created pull request [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider with job lifecycle management (24 commits, relates to [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) and [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880))

- Fixed Claude CLI invocation bug and inline Jira link formatting in publishing script
- Explored fulfillment-service architecture and hub concept for multi-cluster orchestration
- Refactored ComputeInstance CRD to use nested JobStatus structure (~70 code changes across 6 files)
- Updated all unit tests (58 passing) and integration tests to work with nested job status structure
- Regenerated CRD manifests with new nested schema and zero linter issues
- Deployed refactored operator to vmaas-dev cluster and validated with E2E tests (2/2 passing)
- Updated PR [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) with nested job status documentation and examples
- Updated osac-test-infra test playbooks to use jsonpath with nested field access
