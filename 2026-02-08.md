# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Created pull request [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider implementation with job lifecycle management
- Completed CRD refactoring to convert flat job status fields to nested JobStatus structure across 6 files (~70 code changes)
- Validated all baseline E2E tests passing (3/3) and deployed refactored code to vmaas-dev cluster
- Fixed critical EDA provider deletion infinite loop bug by implementing provider-specific deletion logic with `ShouldProceedWithDeprovision` interface
- Completed latency comparison experiment: AAP Direct provisions 4.4x faster than EDA (147s vs 649s average), 3x faster overall lifecycle
- Improved code quality: replaced `interface{}` with `any` (39 replacements), added typed errors for HTTP 405/404, increased test coverage (AAP 73.9% → 87.0%, Provisioning 70.4% → 74.1%)
- Fixed daily status automation with systemd timer, logging, and GitHub Pages publishing at https://tzvatot.github.io/daily-status/
- Analyzed and documented AAP Direct optimistic concurrency mechanism preventing duplicate job triggers using Kubernetes resourceVersion
- Related: [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031), [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880)

## Risks & Challenges
- **CRITICAL:** AAP Direct provider missing ReconciledConfigVersion update on provision success - currently works due to annotation workaround from old EDA playbook, but needs fix in `getJobStatus()` to properly detect spec changes
- Provider abstraction refactoring in progress to eliminate `switch r.ProvisioningProvider.Name()` statements from controller (requires CRD changes for `BlockDeletionOnFailure` field)

## Key Effort
Implementing and validating AAP Direct provider with comprehensive testing, bug fixes, and performance benchmarking showing 4.4x faster provisioning than EDA
