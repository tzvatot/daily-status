# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Completed comprehensive test coverage analysis for AAP Direct provider - identified 21 test scenarios across 3 priority levels
- Validated baseline E2E tests for AAP Direct provider implementation (3/3 passing: basic creation/deletion, restart functionality, delete during provisioning)
- Created pull request [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider with job lifecycle management (24 commits, ready for review) - closes [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031)

- Created systemd timer service for automated daily status publishing (runs every 15 minutes with automatic failure notifications)
- Completed architecture deep dive on hub concept in cloudkit-operator and fulfillment-service (multi-cluster orchestration patterns)
- Implemented CRD refactoring for [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880): converted flat job status fields to nested JobStatus structure (6 files modified, all tests passing)
- Validated refactoring with full test suite: 58 unit tests, 3 integration tests, linter checks, and CRD manifest generation
