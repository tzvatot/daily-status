# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Created [pull request #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider implementation with 24 commits
- Validated baseline E2E tests (3/3 passing) for [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031)
- Refactored ComputeInstance CRD to use nested JobStatus structure (~70 code changes, all 60 tests passing)
- Deployed refactored operator to vmaas-dev cluster and validated with E2E tests (2/2 passing)
- Improved test coverage: AAP package 73.9% → 87.0% (+13.1%), Provisioning package 70.4% → 74.1% (+3.7%)
- Replaced deprecated `interface{}` with `any` type alias (39 replacements across 4 files)
- Fixed daily status automation: GitHub Pages publishing, logging, notifications, and Claude CLI integration
- Implemented systemd timer for automated status publishing (15-minute intervals)
- Established AAP Direct latency baseline: avg 171s provision, 104s deprovision (3 runs)
- Discovered and documented critical bug in EDA provider deletion flow (infinite loop in `ensureProvisionJobTerminated`)
- Identified critical gap: AAP Direct missing ReconciledConfigVersion update on successful provision

## Risks & Challenges
- EDA provider deletion blocked by infinite loop bug (VMs stuck in Deleting phase indefinitely)
- AAP Direct provider missing ReconciledConfigVersion mechanism - prevents spec change detection
- Latency comparison experiment incomplete due to EDA deletion bug

## Key Effort
Implementing and validating nested JobStatus CRD refactoring with comprehensive test coverage and deployment testing
