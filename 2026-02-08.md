# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Created [PR #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider implementation with comprehensive test coverage ([MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031), [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880))
- Validated baseline E2E tests: all 3 tests passing (basic creation/deletion, restart functionality, delete during provisioning)
- Implemented CRD refactoring to convert flat job status fields to nested JobStatus structure (~70 code changes, 60 tests passing)
- Deployed refactored operator to vmaas-dev cluster and validated with E2E tests (2/2 passing)
- Fixed daily status automation: GitHub Pages publishing restored, systemd timer enabled (15-minute intervals), logging and desktop notifications added
- Improved code quality: replaced deprecated `interface{}` with `any` (39 replacements), added missing AAP unit tests
- Increased test coverage: AAP client 73.9% → 87.0% (+13.1%), provisioning package 70.4% → 74.1% (+3.7%)
- Documented optimistic concurrency pattern preventing duplicate AAP job triggers during reconcile races
- Designed and began latency comparison experiment (AAP Direct vs EDA): established AAP Direct baseline (avg 171s provision, 104s deprovision)

## Risks & Challenges
- **CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED:** EDA provider deletion stuck in infinite loop - `ensureProvisionJobTerminated()` assumes all providers support job status polling, but EDA returns perpetual "Running" state. Blocks all EDA deletions. Fix designed: skip cancellation check when ComputeInstance phase=Ready.
- **CRITICAL MISSING FEATURE:** AAP Direct provider doesn't set ReconciledConfigVersion when provision succeeds - prevents detecting spec changes vs already-reconciled state. Currently works via workaround (reads old EDA annotation), but needs proper implementation in `getJobStatus()`.
- Latency comparison experiment blocked until EDA deletion bug fixed (3 VMs stuck in Deleting phase)

## Key Effort
Implementing and validating nested job status structure refactoring while discovering critical EDA provider deletion bug during latency testing
