# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Analyzed AAP Direct provider implementation and created comprehensive test plan with 21 scenarios across 3 priority levels
- Validated baseline E2E tests (3/3 passing: basic creation/deletion, restart functionality, delete during provisioning)
- Created pull request [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider with job lifecycle management (24 commits addressing [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) and [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880))
- Fixed daily-status repository GitHub Pages publishing and made site live at https://tzvatot.github.io/daily-status/
- Enhanced publishing script with comprehensive logging, error handling, and desktop notifications via systemd timer (15-minute intervals)
- Explored hub architecture in cloudkit-operator and fulfillment-service (multi-cluster orchestration patterns)
- Implemented CRD refactoring to convert flat job status fields to nested JobStatus structure (~70 code changes across 6 files)
- Updated and passed all unit tests (60 total) and integration tests with new nested structure
- Deployed refactored code to vmaas-dev cluster and validated with E2E tests (2/2 passing)
- Updated PR [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) with nested job status documentation and YAML examples
- Modernized AAP codebase by replacing interface{} with 'any' type alias (39 replacements across 4 files)
- Expanded test coverage with missing unit tests for AAP client and provider (AAP: 73.9% → 87.0%, Provisioning: 70.4% → 74.1%)

## Risks & Challenges

## Key Effort
Implemented and validated nested job status structure refactoring in AAP Direct provider with complete test coverage improvements.
