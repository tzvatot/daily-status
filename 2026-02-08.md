# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Created comprehensive test coverage plan for AAP Direct provider with 21 scenarios across 3 priority levels
- Validated baseline E2E tests: basic creation/deletion, restart functionality, and delete-during-provisioning all passing
- Created pull request [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider with 24 commits implementing job lifecycle management
- Fixed daily status automation: GitHub Pages publishing, added logging and desktop notifications, created systemd timer (15-minute intervals)
- Implemented CRD refactoring: converted flat job status fields to nested JobStatus structure across 6 files
- Successfully deployed refactored operator to vmaas-dev cluster and validated with E2E tests
- Explored fulfillment-service hub architecture and multi-cluster orchestration patterns
- Improved code quality: replaced `interface{}` with `any` (39 replacements), added typed errors for HTTP 405
- Expanded test coverage: AAP client 73.9% → 87.0%, provisioning 70.4% → 74.1%
- Fixed critical bug: EDA provider deletion infinite loop by implementing provider-specific `ShouldProceedWithDeprovision` logic
- Added typed `NotFoundError` for AAP 404 handling when jobs are purged
- Completed latency comparison experiment: AAP Direct 4.4x faster provisioning (147s vs 649s), 3x faster overall lifecycle than EDA
- Documented optimistic concurrency mechanism preventing duplicate job triggers in controller
- Updated [MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031) and [MGMT-22880](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22880) implementation with nested job status structure

## Risks & Challenges
- **CRITICAL:** AAP Direct missing ReconciledConfigVersion update when provision succeeds - impacts spec change detection
- **IN PROGRESS:** Provider abstraction refactoring to eliminate `switch r.ProvisioningProvider.Name()` statements from controller
- Pending code review feedback on PR #102

## Key Effort
Implemented nested job status structure refactoring and fixed critical EDA deletion bug while completing latency comparison showing AAP Direct 3x faster than EDA.
