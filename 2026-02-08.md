# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Created [pull request #102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider implementation with job lifecycle management
- Validated baseline E2E tests (3/3 passing: basic creation/deletion, restart functionality, delete during provisioning)
- Implemented CRD refactoring with nested JobStatus structure (~70 code changes across 6 files)
- Successfully deployed refactored operator to vmaas-dev cluster and validated with E2E tests (2/2 passing)
- Improved AAP code coverage: client package 73.9% → 87.0% (+13.1%), provisioning package 70.4% → 74.1% (+3.7%)
- Modernized Go codebase by replacing deprecated `interface{}` with `any` type (39 replacements)
- Fixed daily status automation with systemd timer (15-minute intervals), GitHub Pages publishing, and comprehensive logging
- Documented hub architecture concept from fulfillment-service (multi-cluster orchestration patterns)
- Established AAP Direct latency baseline (3 runs: avg provision=171s, deprovision=104s, total=275s)
- Discovered and documented critical EDA provider deletion bug (infinite loop in `ensureProvisionJobTerminated`)
- Identified missing ReconciledConfigVersion update in AAP Direct provider success flow

## Risks & Challenges
- **CRITICAL:** EDA provider deletion infinite loop blocks all EDA-provisioned instance deletions - instances stuck in "Deleting" phase indefinitely due to job status polling assumption
- **CRITICAL:** AAP Direct provider missing ReconciledConfigVersion update on successful provision - prevents controller from detecting spec changes vs already-reconciled state
- Latency comparison experiment blocked by EDA deletion bug

## Key Effort
Implementing and validating nested JobStatus structure refactoring in cloudkit-operator with comprehensive E2E testing and code quality improvements
