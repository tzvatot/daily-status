# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Created comprehensive test coverage plan with 21 scenarios across 3 priority levels for AAP Direct provider implementation
- Validated baseline E2E tests - all 3 tests passing (basic creation/deletion, restart functionality, delete during provisioning)
- Created pull request [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider with 24 commits implementing job lifecycle management
- Implemented CRD refactoring to convert flat job status fields to nested JobStatus structure (~70 code changes across 6 files)
- Deployed refactored code to vmaas-dev cluster and validated with E2E tests (2/2 passing)
- Fixed daily status automation: enabled GitHub Pages publishing, added comprehensive logging and desktop notifications via systemd timer (15-minute intervals)
- Modernized Go code by replacing `interface{}` with `any` (39 replacements across 4 files)
- Expanded test coverage: AAP client 73.9% → 87.0% (+13.1%), Provisioning 70.4% → 74.1% (+3.7%) - all 60 tests passing
- Completed AAP Direct latency baseline measurements (3 runs): average provision 171s, deprovision 104s, total 275s
- Discovered and documented critical bug in EDA provider deletion flow causing infinite loop when deleting Ready instances
- Identified missing ReconciledConfigVersion update in AAP Direct provider ([MGMT-23031](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-23031))
- Explored hub concept in fulfillment-service architecture and multi-cluster orchestration patterns
- Documented optimistic concurrency implementation preventing duplicate AAP job triggers using Kubernetes resourceVersion

## Risks & Challenges
- **CRITICAL:** EDA provider deletion bug blocks all deprovisioning - ComputeInstances stuck in "Deleting" phase indefinitely due to infinite loop in `ensureProvisionJobTerminated()` when provision job state remains "Running"
- **CRITICAL:** AAP Direct missing ReconciledConfigVersion update mechanism - provider doesn't set status field when provision job succeeds, preventing spec change detection
- Latency comparison experiment blocked until EDA deletion bug is resolved

## Key Effort
Implementing and validating nested JobStatus CRD refactoring while discovering critical bugs in EDA provider deletion flow and ReconciledConfigVersion handling
