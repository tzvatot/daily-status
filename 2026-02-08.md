# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Created comprehensive test coverage plan for AAP Direct provider implementation with 21 test scenarios across 3 priority levels
- Executed and validated all baseline E2E tests (3/3 passing): basic creation/deletion, restart functionality, and delete-during-provisioning
- Created pull request [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider with job lifecycle management (24 commits, ready for review)
- Implemented CRD refactoring to convert flat job status fields to nested JobStatus structure (~70 code changes across 6 files)
- Fixed daily status automation: enabled GitHub Pages publishing, added comprehensive logging, fixed Claude CLI invocation bug, and created systemd timer for automatic 15-minute publishing
- Explored fulfillment-service architecture and learned hub concept for multi-cluster orchestration patterns
- Modernized AAP codebase by replacing deprecated `interface{}` with `any` type (39 replacements)
- Expanded test coverage: AAP client 73.9% → 87.0% (+13.1%), provisioning package 70.4% → 74.1% (+3.7%)
- Discovered and fixed critical EDA provider deletion infinite loop bug by implementing provider-specific deletion logic with `ShouldProceedWithDeprovision` interface
- Added typed `NotFoundError` handling for AAP 404 responses when jobs are purged
- Deployed bug fixes to vmaas-dev cluster (image b4b15d3) and verified stuck VMs successfully deleted
- Completed latency comparison experiment between AAP Direct and EDA providers (3 parallel tests each)
- **Key finding:** AAP Direct provides 4.4x faster provisioning (147s vs 649s), 3x faster overall lifecycle (238s vs 725s) compared to EDA

## Risks & Challenges
- **CRITICAL:** AAP Direct missing ReconciledConfigVersion update - provider doesn't set this field when provision job succeeds, preventing controller from detecting spec changes vs already reconciled state (currently works due to workaround reading old EDA playbook annotations)

## Key Effort
Implementing AAP Direct provider with nested job status structure, fixing EDA deletion bug, and quantifying 4.4x provisioning performance improvement over EDA
