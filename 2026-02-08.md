# Daily Status - 2026-02-08

## Accomplishments
- Analyzed AAP Direct provider implementation and created comprehensive test plan covering 21 scenarios across 3 priority levels
- Executed baseline E2E tests for AAP Direct provider - all 3 tests passing (basic creation/deletion, restart functionality, delete during provisioning)
- Created pull request [#102](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator/pull/102) for AAP Direct provider implementation with 24 commits
- Implemented CRD refactoring to convert flat job status fields to nested JobStatus structure (~70 code changes across 6 files)
- Deployed refactored operator to vmaas-dev and validated E2E tests with nested structure
- Fixed daily status automation - enabled GitHub Pages publishing, added comprehensive logging and desktop notifications, fixed Claude CLI invocation
- Created systemd timer service for automated daily status publishing (runs every 15 minutes)
- Replaced deprecated `interface{}` with `any` in AAP code (39 replacements across 4 files)
- Expanded test coverage: AAP client package 73.9% → 87.0% (+13.1%), Provisioning package 70.4% → 74.1% (+3.7%)
- Discovered and fixed critical bug in EDA provider deletion flow - implemented provider-specific deletion logic with `ShouldProceedWithDeprovision` interface
- Added typed `NotFoundError` for AAP 404 handling (purged jobs)
- Completed latency comparison experiment: AAP Direct vs EDA provisioning
  - AAP Direct: 147s provision, 90s deprovision (avg) - **4.4x faster provisioning**
  - EDA: 649s provision, 76s deprovision (avg)
  - Overall lifecycle: AAP Direct 3x faster than EDA (238s vs 725s)
- Explored hub concept in fulfillment-service architecture and multi-cluster orchestration patterns
- Analyzed optimistic concurrency implementation preventing duplicate AAP job triggers

## Risks & Challenges
- **CRITICAL:** AAP Direct missing ReconciledConfigVersion update when provision job succeeds - controller cannot detect spec changes vs already reconciled state without this field
- EDA provider deletion bug blocked latency experiment until fixed (now resolved)
- grpcurl binary missing on test system (minor impact)

## Key Effort
Implemented and validated nested job status CRD refactoring, fixed critical EDA deletion bug, and completed AAP Direct vs EDA latency comparison showing 4.4x provisioning speedup
